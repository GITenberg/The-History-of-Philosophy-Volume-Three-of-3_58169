<p class="pc4 mid">PART TWO</p>

<p class="pc1 large">PHILOSOPHY OF THE MIDDLE AGES</p>

<h2 class="p2" id="c1a">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> first period embraces a space of one thousand years—from
Thales, 550 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, to Proclus, who died 485 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, and
until the disappearance of pagan philosophy as an outward
institution, 529 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> The second period extends to the
sixteenth century, and thus again embraces a thousand
years, to pass over which we must provide ourselves with
seven-leagued boots. While Philosophy has hitherto found
its place in the religion of the heathen, from this time on
it has its sphere within the Christian world; for Arabians
and Jews have only to be noticed in an external and
historic way.</p>

<p id="c1b">1. Through the Neo-Platonic philosophy we have come
into quite familiar acquaintance with the Idea of Christianity,
as the new religion which has entered into the
world. For the Neo-Platonic philosophy has as its essential
principle the fact that the Absolute is determined as
spirit in a concrete way, that God is not a mere conception.
Although the Absolute is Thought, it must, in order to be
true, be concrete in itself and not abstract; in what we
have just seen we have, then, the first appearance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
absolutely existent spirit. But in spite of their profound
and true speculation, the Neo-Platonists still had not proved
their doctrine that the Trinity is the truth, for there is
lacking to it the form of inward necessity. The Neo-Platonists
begin from the One that determines itself, that
sets a limit to itself from which the determinate proceeds;
this, however, is itself an immediate method of presentation,
and it is this that makes such philosophers as Plotinus
and Proclus so tiresome. Undoubtedly dialectic considerations
enter in, in which the opposites which are conceived
as absolute are shown to be null; but this dialectic is not
methodical, but occurs only disconnectedly. The principle
of retroversion and comprehension found with the Neo-Platonists
is that of substantiality generally, but because
subjectivity is lacking, this idea of Spirit is deficient in one
moment, the moment of actuality, of the point which
draws all moments into one, and which thereby becomes
immediate unity, universality, and Being. To them spirit
is thus not individual spirit; and this deficiency is made
good through Christianity, in which spirit is found as
actual, present spirit, immediately existent in the world
here and now, and the absolute spirit is known in the
immediate present as man.</p>

<p>In order to grasp and apply the Idea of Christianity, the
philosophic Idea of which we have already spoken in connection
with the Neo-Platonists must have been comprehended
for itself; but within Christianity the basis of
Philosophy is that in man has sprung up the consciousness
of the truth, or of spirit in and for itself, and then that man
requires to participate in this truth. Man must be qualified
to have this truth present to him; he must further be convinced
of this possibility. This is the absolute demand and
necessity; the consciousness must be arrived at that this
alone is true. The first point of interest in the Christian
religion thus is that the content of the Idea should be
revealed to man; more particularly that the unity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
divine and human nature should come to the consciousness
of man, and that, indeed, on the one hand as an implicitly
existent unity, and, on the other, in actuality as worship.
The Christian life signifies that the culminating point of
subjectivity is made familiar with this conception, the
individual himself is laid claim to, is made worthy of
attaining on his own account to this unity, which is to
make himself worthy of the Spirit of God—Grace, as it
is called—dwelling in him. Hence the doctrine of reconciliation
is that God is known as reconciling Himself with
the world, <i>i.e.</i> as we have seen in the Neo-Platonic philosophy,
that He particularizes Himself and does not remain
abstract. Not external nature alone, but the whole world
pertains to the particular; above all must human individuality
know itself in God. The interest of the subject is itself
involved, and here it plays an essential rôle in order that
God may be realized and may realize Himself in the consciousness
of individuals who are spirit and implicitly free.
Thus through the process these accomplish that reconciliation
in themselves, actualize their freedom; that is to say,
they attain to the consciousness of heaven upon earth, the
elevation of man to God. Thus the true intellectual world
is not a beyond, but the so-called finite is an element in it,
and no division exists between this side and that. The real
concrete in regard to the absolute Idea is the knowing of
the mundane, the ‘other’ in God, as implicitly divine, as
universal, as the world of intellect, as having its root in
God, but only the root. In God man is accepted only
in his truth, and not in his immediacy, and thus this
doctrine is not what we call Pantheism, for that leaves the
immediate just as it is. Man then has himself to accomplish
the process of reconciliation in himself in order to
attain to his truth. We have thus seen that man possesses
the determination and attributes of God as the first begotten
son, Adam Kadmon, the first man; we may call this unity
the concrete Idea, which, however, is still only implicit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>But the fact that because man is capable of the divine,
the identity of the divine and human nature must likewise
be present for him, has in an immediate way become known
to him in Christ, as one in whom the divine and human
nature are implicitly one. In the world what has come to
pass is that the Absolute has been revealed as the concrete,
and, further, not only in thought in a general way as
intelligible world, but because it has in itself proceeded to
its ultimate point of intensity. Thus it is an actual self,
an “I,” the absolute universal, the concrete universal, that
is God; and also the absolute opposite of this determination,
the clearly finite as it exists in space and time, but
this finite determined in unity with the eternal as self.
The Absolute comprehended as concrete, the unity of these
two absolutely different determinations, is the true God;
each of them is abstract, and either of them taken by itself
is thus not the true God. The fact that the concrete is
thus known to men in this perfection as God, brings about
the whole revolution that has taken place in the world’s
history. The Trinity is thereby not only present in conception,
which would not yet constitute the perfect concrete,
but actuality is perfectly united to it. In the consciousness
of the world it has consequently broken in upon men that
the Absolute has attained to this “culminating point” of
immediate actuality, as Proclus says; and that is the
manifestation of Christianity. The Greeks were anthropomorphic,
their gods were humanly constituted; but the
deficiency in them is that they were not anthropomorphic
enough. Or rather the Greek religion is on the one hand
too much, and, on the other hand, too little anthropomorphic—too
much, because immediate qualities, forms, actions,
are taken up into the divine; too little, because man is not
divine as man, but only as a far-away form and not as
‘this,’ and subjective man.</p>

<p>Thus man reaches this truth, because for him it becomes
a sure intuition that in Christ the λόγος has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Flesh. We thus first have man through this process
attaining to spirituality, and in the second place we have
man as Christ, in whom this original identity of both
natures is known. Now since man really is this process of
being the negation of the immediate, and from this negation
attaining to himself—to a unity with God—he must
consequently renounce his natural will, knowledge, and existence.
This giving up of his natural existence is witnessed
in Christ’s sufferings and death, and in His resurrection
and elevation to the right hand of the Father. Christ
became a perfect man, endured the lot of all men, death;
as man He suffered, sacrificed Himself, gave up His natural
existence, and thereby elevated Himself above it. In Him
this process, this conversion of His other-being into spirit,
and the necessity of pain in the renunciation of the natural
man is witnessed; but this pain, the pain of feeling that God
Himself is dead, is the starting point of holiness and of
elevation to God. Thus what must come to pass in the
subject—this process, this conversion of the finite—is
known as implicitly accomplished in Christ. This constitutes
the great leading Idea of Christianity.</p>

<p>From what has been said it follows, in the second place,
that the world must not be left in its immediate naturalness.
The original, implicitly existent, is found only in the strictest
conception of mind, or as its determination: immediately,
man is only a living being, who has indeed the capacity to
become actual spirit—but spirit does not pertain to nature.
Man is thus not by nature this particular in which the
spirit of God lives and dwells: man is not by nature what
he ought to be. The animal is by nature what it ought to
be. But what has to be noticed in this respect is that
natural things merely remain in their implicit Notion, or
their truth does not enter into their sensuous life, for this
their natural individuality is only a fleeting fact that cannot
look back on itself. The misfortune in natural things is
that they get no further, that their essential nature is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for itself and independent; from this it follows that they
do not attain to infinitude, to liberation from their immediate
individuality, <i>i.e.</i> they do not attain to freedom, but only
remain in the necessity which is the connection of the
“one” with an “other,” so that when this other unites
itself to natural things, these last perish because they cannot
bear the contradiction. But because the truth exists
for man as consciousness, and in it he has the qualities
necessary for freedom, he is capable of perceiving the
Absolute, of placing himself in a relation to the same, and
having knowledge as an end; and the liberation of mind
depends on the fact that consciousness does not remain in
its natural condition, but becomes spiritual, <i>i.e.</i> that for it
the eternal, that is the reconciliation of the finite as this
subject with the infinite, exists. Thus consciousness does
not signify remaining in the sphere of nature, but the
existence of the process whereby the universal becomes
object or end to man. Man makes himself divine, but in
a spiritual, that is to say not in an immediate way. In the
ancient religions the divine is also united to the natural or
human; but this unity is no reconciliation, but an immediate,
undeveloped, and thus unspiritual unity, just because it is
merely natural. But because mind is not natural but only
that into which it makes itself, the spiritual is first met
with in this very process of producing unity. To this
spiritual unity pertains the negation of nature, of the flesh,
as that in which man must not rest; for nature is from the
beginning evil. Man is likewise naturally evil, for all the
wickedness that man does proceeds from a natural desire.
Now because man is in himself the image of God, but in
existence is only natural, that which is implicit must be
evolved, while the first natural condition must be abrogated.
So much the more is it true that man first becomes spiritual,
and attains to truth through rising above the natural, inasmuch
as God Himself is a spirit only in that He transformed
the hidden unity into the other of Himself, in
order from this other to turn back again into Himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the fact that this is given as, or asserted to be the
fundamental Idea of Christianity, implies on the one hand
an historic question; at different times this idea has been
grasped in different ways, and now, for example, men again
have their particular conceptions of it. In order to bring
about the conclusion that this is the historic idea of Christianity,
we should have to enter upon an historic disquisition;
but because we cannot deal with this here, we must accept
it as an historic axiom. On the other hand, in so far as
this question falls within the history of Philosophy, the
assertion that this is the idea of Christianity has another
ground to stand on than that of history, and this constitutes
the third point of interest. In connection with the preceding
forms it has been shown that this Idea of Christianity
must have now come forth, and indeed become the universal
consciousness of the nations. The fact that it has come
forth as the world-religion, is the content of history; it is
this necessity in the Idea which has to be expounded more
clearly in the philosophy of history. To this end the conception
of mind must be made fundamental, and it must now
be shown that history is the process of mind itself, the
revelation of itself from its first superficial, enshrouded
consciousness, and the attainment of this standpoint of its
free self-consciousness, in order that the absolute command
of mind, “Know thyself,” may be fulfilled. The recognition
of this necessity has been called the <i>à priori</i> construction
of history; there is no good in decrying it as inadmissible,
and indeed as arrogant. The development of history may
be represented as contingent. Or, if the providence and
government of God are seriously accepted, these are represented
as though Christianity were so to speak ready made
in the mind of God; then, when thrust into the world, it
appears to be contingent. But the rationality and likewise
the necessity of this decree of God’s has now to be considered,
and this may be called a theodicy, a justification
of God, <i>i.e.</i> a vindication of our Idea. It is a demonstration
that, as I have just said, things have happened rationally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the world, and it implies the fact that the world-history
represents the process of mind partially as the history of
mind, which has to be reflected into itself in order to come
to a consciousness of what it is. It is this which is shown
forth in temporal history, and as history, indeed, just
because mind is the living movement, proceeding from its
immediate existence to beget revolutions in the world, as
well as in individuals.</p>

<p>Since it is hereby presupposed that this Idea must
necessarily become universal religion, there is, in the fourth
place, present in it the source of a method of knowledge
proper to the particular consciousness. That is to say, the
new religion has made the intelligible world of Philosophy
the world of common consciousness. Tertullian hence says:
“Even children in our day have a knowledge of God,
which the wisest men of antiquity alone attained to.” But
in order that all may know the truth, this Idea must come
to them as an object, not for the thinking, philosophic and
cultured consciousness, but for the sensuous consciousness
which still adheres to uncultured methods of regarding
things. If this Idea were not to receive and to retain this
form of outward consciousness, it would be a philosophy of
the Christian religion; for the standpoint of Philosophy
is the Idea in the form of the merely universal thought,
and not the Idea as it is for the subject and directed to
the subject. That through which this Idea appears as
religion, belongs, however, to the history of religion,
and this development of its form must here be passed
over. Through these forms we must however not mistake
the content, much less reject it altogether, for we must
rather recognize its presence more completely; the forms
must likewise not be held to be absolute, and we must not
try to maintain the doctrines in this form alone, as was at
one time done by an orthodoxy “of straw.”</p>

<p>Only one example will here be given. The so-called
doctrine of original sin implies that our first parents have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sinned, that this sin has thus descended to all mankind as
an hereditary disorder, and has come upon posterity in an
external way as something inherent in their nature, which
does not pertain to freedom of the mind, nor has its ground
therein. Through this original sin, it is further signified,
man has drawn upon himself the wrath of God. Now if
these forms be adhered to, we have in the first place there
the first parents in time, and not in thought; but the
thought of these first parents is none other than man as he
is in and for himself. What is said of him as such, what
every member of the human race really is in himself,
is represented here in the form of the first man, Adam;
and in this first man sin manifests itself as something contingent,
or, more particularly, in his allowing himself to
be enticed into eating of the apple. But it is again not
merely represented that he simply partook of the fruit, but
that he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;
it is as man that he must partake of it, and not as beast.
The fundamental characteristic, however, through which
he distinguishes himself from the animal, is the very fact
that he knows what good and evil are. For God likewise
says, “Behold, Adam has become as one of us, to know
good and evil.” But it is only through man’s having the
power of thinking that he can make this distinction between
good and evil; in thought alone is there thus the source
of good and evil, but the healing of the evil which is
brought about through thought is also there. The second
point is that man is by nature evil and transmits the evil.
On the other hand, it is said: “Why should the sinner
suffer punishment seeing that there is no responsibility for
what is inborn in him?” As a matter of fact the statement
that man is implicitly or by nature evil would seem
to be a hard saying. But if we set aside this hard saying,
and do not speak of a divine punishment, but make use of
milder general expressions, in this idea of original sin the
fact remains for us that man as he is by nature is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
what he ought to be before God, but has the power of
becoming explicitly what he only is implicitly; and the fact
that this rests in the determination of man as such is
represented as inheritance. The abrogation of mere
naturalness is known to us simply as education, and arises
of itself; through education subjection is brought about,
and with that a capacity for becoming good is developed.
Now if this appears to come to pass very easily, we must
recollect that it is of infinite importance that the reconciliation
of the world with itself, the making good, is
brought about through the simple method of education.</p>

<p id="c10">2. What concerns us now is to make the Principle of
Christianity, which has been explained at considerable
length, into the principle of the world; the task set before
the world is to bring this absolute Idea within itself, to
actualize it in itself, and thereby to reconcile itself to God.
This task once more falls into three separate divisions.</p>

<p>In the first place we have the dissemination of the
Christian religion and the bringing of it within the hearts
of men; this, however, lies outside the limits of our consideration.
The heart signifies the subjective man as
‘this,’ and through this principle the latter has a different
position from before; it is essential that this subject should
be present. The individual subject is the object of divine
grace; each subject, or man as man, has on his own account
an infinite value, is destined to partake of this spirit which
must, as God, be born within the heart of every man.
Man is determined for freedom, he is here recognized as
implicitly free; this freedom is, however, at first only
formal, because it remains within the principle of
subjectivity.</p>

<p>The second point is that the principle of the Christian
religion should be worked out for thought, and be taken
up into thinking knowledge, and realized in this; and thus
that it should attain to reconciliation, having the divine
Idea within itself, and that the riches of thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
culture belonging to the philosophic Idea should become
united to the Christian principle. For the philosophic
Idea is the Idea of God, and thought has the absolute
right of reconciliation, or the right to claim that the
Christian principle should correspond with thought. The
Fathers have rendered the service of thus elaborating the
Christian religion in thinking knowledge; but neither
have we to consider further this development of the
Christian principle, since it belongs to the history of the
Church. We have only here to give the point of view
adopted regarding the relation of the Fathers to
Philosophy. They for the most part lived within the
ancient Roman world and in Latin culture, though the
Byzantines likewise are included with them. We know
that the Fathers were men of great philosophic culture,
and that they introduced Philosophy, and more especially
Neo-Platonic philosophy, into the Church; in this way
they worked out a Christian system by which the first mode
in which Christianity was manifested in the world was
supplemented, for system was not present in this first
manifestation. The Fathers have dealt with all questions
respecting the nature of God, the freedom of man, the
relationship to God—who is the objective—the origin of
evil, and so on; and whatever thought decided regarding
these questions was by them brought into and incorporated
with the Christian system. The nature of spirit, the way
of salvation, <i>i.e.</i> the various stages in the spiritualizing of
the subject, his growth, the process of spirit, whereby it is
spirit, the changes it has undergone, they have likewise
treated in its freedom, and recognized its moments in the
depths to which it reaches.</p>

<p>We may thus describe the attitude of the Christian
Fathers, and likewise remark that this first philosophic
development of the Christian principle has been looked on
as a crime on their part, and it has been said that they
have thus corrupted the purity of Christianity as originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
manifested. We must speak of the nature of this corruption.
It is well known that Luther in his Reformation
made his aim the bringing of the Church back to the purity
of its first estate in the early centuries, but this first condition
already shows the fabric of an extensive and closely
interwoven system, an elaborate tissue of doctrines regarding
what God is and what is man’s relation to Him. Hence
at the time of the Reformation no particular system was
built up, but what was originally there was purified from
later additions; it is a complicated erection, in which the
most intricate pieces of workmanship are to be found. In
modern times this elaborately woven system has been
entirely pulled to pieces, because men have wished to bring
Christianity back to the simple lines of the Word of God
as found in the writings of the New Testament. Men have
likewise given up the propagation of the system, the
doctrine of Christianity as determined through the Idea
and by the Idea, and have returned to the manner of its
first appearance (and that, indeed, in eclectic fashion, and
having regard to what will fit in with their own notions),
so that now only the original Gospel narrative is regarded
as forming the basis of Christianity. As regards the title
of Philosophy and the Fathers to bring Philosophy into
Christianity we have the following remarks to make.</p>

<p>Modern Theology on the one hand derives its formulas
from the words of the Bible, which are made to form their
basis, so that the whole business of the individual, as regards
his thoughts and his conceptions, is merely exegetical;
religion must be retained in its positive form, and thus it
is from something received and given, something most
evidently externally posited and revealed, that a beginning
must be made. These words and this text are, however,
of a nature such that they allow full latitude to the will of
the interpreter; hence the other side is also present, or
the application of the Bible saying: “The letter killeth,
but the spirit giveth life.” This must be assented to, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the spirit means none else than the power which dwells
within those who apply themselves to the letter in order
that they may spiritually apprehend and animate it. This
signifies that it is the conceptions which we bring along
with us which have in the letter to give efficacy to themselves.
Now these reflections brought along with us may be grasped
by the most ordinary human understanding, which is
what is indicated in modern times when we say that
dogmas must be popular. In that way the right to act
upon the letter with the spirit is assumed, <i>i.e.</i> the right to
approach it with our individual judgment; but to the
Fathers this is forbidden. They did act upon it with
the Spirit; and it is expressly said that the Spirit dwells
within the Church, directs, teaches, and illuminates it.
The Fathers have hence a similar right to relate themselves
with the Spirit to the positive, to what is given by the senses.
Only it will depend absolutely upon what the nature of
the Spirit is, for spirits are very different.</p>

<p>The assertion that the spirit must give life to the mere
letter is certainly more definitely stated as that spirit has
only to expound what is given, <i>i.e.</i> it must leave the actual
sense of what is immediately contained in the words. We
must, however, be far behind in culture if we do not see
the fallacy in the attitude here adopted. To expound
without the individual spirit, as though the sense were one
entirely given, is impossible. To elucidate signifies to make
clear, and it must be made clear to me; this can be done
by nothing excepting what was already present in me. It
must be in conformity with my subjective judgment, the
necessities of my knowledge, of my apprehension, of
my heart, &amp;c.; thus only is it for me. We find what we
look for, and just because I make it clear to myself, I make
my conception, my thought, a factor in it; otherwise it is
a dead and external thing, which is not present for me at
all. It is hence very difficult to make clear to ourselves
those foreign religions which lie far below our spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
needs; but yet they touch a side of my spiritual necessities
and standpoints, although it is but a dim and sensuous
side. Thus when we talk of “making clear,” we conceal
the real matter in a word; but if this word itself is made
clear we find nothing in it but the fact that the spirit
which is in man desires therein to recognize itself, and
that it cannot know anything which does not rest in
him. Thus have men made of the Bible what may be
called a nose of wax. This man finds this thing, the
other man that; what was secure now shows itself as
insecure, because it is considered by the subjective spirit.</p>

<p>In this regard the nature of the text describing the
method in which the first manifestation of Christianity
took place, must be remarked upon; it cannot as yet
expressly contain that which rests in the principle of
Christianity, but only somewhat of an anticipation of what
spirit is and will know as true. This also is expressly
said in the text itself. Christ says: “If I depart, I will
send the Comforter, the Holy Ghost.... He will guide you
into all truth,” He—and not Christ’s earthly presence nor
His spoken words. It was only to be after Him, and after
His teaching through the text, that the Spirit was to come
into the Apostles, and that they were to become full of the
Spirit. It might almost be said that when Christianity is
carried back to its first appearing, it is brought down to
the level of unspirituality, for Christ Himself says that the
Spirit will not come until He Himself has departed. In
the text of the first manifestation of Christianity we, on the
other hand, see Christ only as the Messiah, or under the
more explicit designation of a mere teacher; for His friends
and apostles He is a present man whom they can perceive
by the senses, and who does not yet hold to them the
relationship of the Holy Ghost. His friends have seen
Him, heard His doctrine, seen His miracles, and have
thereby been brought to believe in Him. But Christ
Himself sternly rebukes those who demand miracles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Him; if He thus be made as God to man, God in the
heart of man, He cannot have a sensuous and immediate
presence. The Dalai-lama, in the form of a sensuous man,
is God to the inhabitants of Thibet, but in the Christian
principle, where God dwells in the hearts of men, He
cannot be present to them in sensuous form.</p>

<p>The second point then is that the sensuous and present
form must disappear, so that it may be taken into the
Mnemosyne, into the realm of popular conception; then
for the first time can the spiritual consciousness, the
spiritual relation, enter in. To the question of whither
Christ has gone, the answer is given, “He sits on the
right hand of God,” which signifies that it is only now that
God can be known as this concrete One, as the One
who has the other moment, His Son (λόγος, σοφία), in
Himself. Thus to know what is the principle of
Christianity as truth, the truth of the Idea of spirit
must be known as concrete spirit, and this is the form
peculiar to the Fathers of the Church. With this the idea
that the abstractly divine breaks up and has broken up
within itself, first began to appear. This other moment
in the divine must not, however, be grasped in the mode of
an intelligible world, or, as we certainly have it in the
ordinary conception, of a kingdom of heaven with many
angels, who are also finite, limited, thus approaching
closer to humanity. But it is not sufficient that the
concrete moment should be known in God, for the
further knowledge is requisite that Christ is an actual
present man. This moment of Christ’s actual present
humanity is of immense importance to Christianity,
because it is the union of the most tremendous opposites.
This higher conception could not have been present in the
text, in the first manifestation; the greatness of the Idea
could only come in later on, after the Spirit had perfected
the Idea.</p>

<p>That the revelation of Christ has this significance is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
belief of Christians, while the profane, immediate and
direct significance of this history is that Christ was a mere
prophet and met the fate of all the prophets in being misunderstood.
But the fact that it has the significance given
by us is known through the Spirit, for the Spirit is revealed
in this history. This history is the Notion, the Idea of
Spirit itself, and the world-history has in it found its end,
which is in this immediate way to know the truth. It is
therefore the Spirit which so comprehends that history,
and at the time of Pentecost this is shown in an immediate
and evident manner. For before this time the Apostles
did not know the infinite significance of Christ; they did
not yet know that this is the infinite history of God; they
had believed in Him, but not yet as seeing in Him this
infinite truth.</p>

<p>This is the truth which the Fathers developed; the
general relation of the first Christian Church to Philosophy
is hereby given. On the one hand, the philosophic Idea
has been transplanted into this religion; on the other, this
moment in the Idea—according to which the latter breaks
up within itself into wisdom, the active Logos, the Son of
God, &amp;c., but yet in so doing remains in universality—has
been brought to a culmination in subjectivity,
and further in the sensuous immediate individuality and
present existence of a human individual appearing in time
and space. These two elements are essentially intermingled
in this Christian system, the Idea itself, and secondly the
form as it presents itself through its connection with a
single individuality present in time and space. To the
Fathers this history had thus the Idea as its principle; the
true Idea of the Spirit was consequently to them likewise
in the determinate form of history. But the Idea was not
yet, as such, separated from history; because the Church
thus held to this Idea in historic form, it determined the
doctrines. This, then, is the general character of the time.</p>

<p>From this Idea as comprehended through the Spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
many so-called heresies arose in the first centuries after
Christ. Among such heretics must be included those of
the Gnostics who take the Christian literature as their
basis, but give a spiritual significance to everything therein
present. For they did not remain at this historical form of
the Idea of Spirit, since they interpreted the history and deprived
it of its historical value. The reflections which they
introduced are, as we have seen (Vol. II., pp. 396-399), to
a greater or less extent such as are to be found in the
philosophy of the Alexandrians or of Philo. In conformity
with their principles they adopted a speculative attitude,
but they proceeded into extravagances both of the imagination
and morality, although in this dim fantastic region
the elements which we found in history may always be
recognized. But the form of immediate existence, an
essential moment in Christ, is by them etherealized into a
universal thought, so that the determination of the individual
as a ‘this’ disappears. The Docetæ, for example,
said that Christ had only a phantom body, a phantom life;
yet in such assertions thought still constituted the background.
The Gnostics were thus antagonistic to the
Western Church, and, like Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists,
this last strove hard against Gnosticism, because it remained
in what is general, grasped the conception in the form of
imagination, and because this conception was opposed to
that of Christ in the Flesh (Χριστὸς ἐν σαρκί).<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Church, on the contrary, held to the definite form of
personality as the principle of concrete actuality.</p>

<p>From the East other forms of opposition in the principles
than those we mentioned in connection with the Gnostics
have been introduced, namely, Light and Darkness, Good
and Evil. But more particularly has this Parsee opposition
emerged in Manichæism, in which God, as the Light
opposes the evil, non-existent (οὐκ ὄν), the ὕλη, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
material, self-annihilating. Evil is that which contains
contradiction in itself: the powers of evil (ὕλη), given over
to themselves and raging in blind enmity against one
another, were met by a gleam from the Kingdom of Light
and thereby attracted, and this light pacified the powers of
evil, so as to cause them to cease from strife and unite
together in order to penetrate into the Kingdom of Light.
As an inducement to make them so act, in order to weaken
and mitigate their blind fury through a power operating
irresistibly, and in order to bring about their final overthrow,
and the universal supremacy of light, of life, of the
soul, the Father of Light delivered over one of the powers
of good. That is the world-soul (ψυχὴ ἁπάντων); it was
swallowed up by the material, and this intermixture is the
basis of the whole creation. Hence the soul is everywhere
disseminated, and in the dead husk it is everywhere working
and striving in man, the microcosm, as in the universe,
the macrocosm, but with unequal power; for where beauty
reveals itself, the Light-principle, the soul, obtains the
mastery over matter, but in the ugly, the hateful, it is
subordinate, and matter is the conqueror. This captive
soul Mani likewise called the Son of Man—that is, of the
primitive man, the heavenly man, of Adam Kadmon. But
only a part of the Light-principle which was destined to
strive with the Kingdom of Evil is in this manner delivered
over; being too weak, it incurred the danger of
being vanquished, and had to deliver over to matter a part
of its armour, this soul. The part of the soul which had
not suffered through such intermingling with matter, but
had raised itself freely to heaven, works from above
for the purification of the imprisoned souls, its kindred
portions of light; and that is Jesus, the Son of Man, in so
far as he has not suffered (ἀπαθής), as distinguished from
the suffering Son of Man, the soul confined within the
universe. But that delivering soul remains in the second
and visible light which is still distinguished from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
first and unapproachable, having its seat there, and by
means of sun and moon exercising influence in the purification
of nature. To Mani the whole course of the
physical as of the spiritual world appears as a process of
purification by means of this soul. The captive principle
of Light required to be raised from the cycle of metempsychosis
to an immediate re-union with the Kingdom of
Light. Hence the pure heavenly soul came down to earth
and appeared in the semblance of human form in order to
reach to the suffering soul (to the νοῦς παθητικός of
Aristotle?) a helping hand. The Manichæans also express
themselves to the effect that God, the Good, goes forth,
illumines, and thus produces an intelligible world. What
comes third is Spirit as turning round, establishing the unity
of the second and first, and experiencing feeling, and this
feeling is Love. This heresy fully recognizes the Idea,
but does away with the form of individual existence in
which the Idea is presented in the Christian religion. The
crucifixion of Christ is consequently taken as merely a
semblance, as allegorical only, simply an image. That
merely phantom crucifixion of the non-suffering Jesus, the
fellow-suffering, only imaginary certainly, of the soul
unmingled with matter, shows forth the actual suffering of
the captive soul. Thus as the forces of Darkness could
exercise no power over Christ, they must also show themselves
powerless over the soul allied thereto. With the
Manichæans originates the conception of a Jesus who is
crucified in all the world and in the soul; the crucifixion
of Christ thus mystically signifies only the wounds of our
suffering souls. Through vegetation the particles of light
were held fast, and thus held fast they were brought forth
as plants. The earth becoming fruitful brings forth the
suffering (<i>patibilis</i>) Jesus, who is the life and salvation of
men and is crucified on every tree. The νοῦς which appeared
in Jesus signifies all things.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The Church has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
likewise made a principal point of asserting the unity of
the divine and human nature. But because this unity in
the Christian religion attained to conceiving consciousness,
human nature was in its actuality taken as ‘this,’ and not
merely in an allegorical or philosophic sense.</p>

<p>Now if, on the one hand, the essential matter with the
orthodox Fathers who opposed themselves to these Gnostic
speculations, is the fact that they held firmly to the definite
form of an objectively conceived Christ, on the other hand
they attacked the Arians and all that pertain to them;
for these recognize the individual as manifested, but do not
place the Person of Christ in connection with the separation,
with the breaking up of the divine Idea. They took
Christ to be a man, accorded to Him indeed a higher
nature, not, however, making Him a moment of God, of
Spirit itself. The Arians did not indeed go so far as the
Socinians, who accepted Christ merely as a man of noble
nature, a teacher, and so on; this sect hence did not form
part of the Church at all, being simply heathen. But still
the Arians, since they did not recognize God in Christ, did
away with the idea of the Trinity, and consequently with
the principle of all speculative philosophy. The according
to Him of a higher nature is likewise a hollow mockery
which cannot satisfy us; as against this the Fathers
accordingly asserted the unity of the divine and human
nature, which has come to consciousness in the individual
members of the Church, and this is a point of fundamental
importance. The Pelagians again, denied original sin, and
maintained that man has by nature sufficient virtue and
religion. But man should not be what he is by nature; he
should be spiritual. And thus this doctrine is likewise excluded
as heretical. Therefore the Church was ruled by
Spirit, to enable it to hold to the determinations of the
Idea, though always in the historic form. This is the
philosophy of the Fathers; they produced the Church, as the
developed Spirit required a developed doctrine, and nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is so out of place as the endeavour or desire of some men
of the present day to lead the Church back to her original
form.</p>

<p>What follows thirdly is that the Idea permeates reality,
is immanent therein, that not only is there a multitude of
believing hearts, but that from the heart, just as the
natural law rules over a sensuous world, a higher life of
the world, a kingdom, is constituted—the reconciliation of
God with Himself is accomplished in the world, and not
as a heavenly kingdom that is beyond. This community
is the kingdom of God upon earth in the Church;
“Where two or three are gathered together in my name,”
says Christ, “there am I in the midst of them.” The Idea
is only for spirit, for subjective consciousness, in so far as
it realizes itself in actuality, and thus it not only has to
bring itself to perfection in the heart, but has to perfect
itself also into a kingdom of actual consciousness. The
Idea which man, self-consciousness, should recognize, must
become altogether objective to him, so that he may truly
apprehend himself as spirit and the Spirit, and then that
he may be spiritual in a spiritual, and not in an emotional
way. The first objectification is found in the first immediate
consciousness of the Idea, where it appeared as an
individual object, as the individual existence of a man.
The second objectivity is the spiritual worship and communion
extended to the Church. We might imagine a
universal community of Love, a world of piety and holiness,
a world of brotherly kindness, of innocent little lambs and
pretty triflings with things spiritual, a divine republic, a
heaven upon earth. But this is not supposed to come to
pass on earth; that imagination is relegated to heaven, <i>i.e.</i>
to some other place, that is to say, it is put off until death.
Each living actuality directs his feelings, actions, and affairs
in a very different way from this. On the appearance
of Christianity it is first of all said: “My kingdom is not
of this world;” but the realization has and ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the present world. In other words the laws, customs,
constitutions, and all that belongs to the actuality of
spiritual consciousness should be rational. The kingdom
of rational actuality is quite a different one, and must be
organized and developed thinkingly and with understanding;
the moment of the self-conscious freedom of the individual
must maintain its rights against objective truth and
objective command. This, then, is the true and actual
objectivity of mind in the form of an actual temporal
existence as state, just as Philosophy is the objectivity
of thought which comes to us in the form of universality.
Such objectivity cannot be in the beginning, but must
come forth after being worked upon by mind and
thought.</p>

<p>In Christianity these absolute claims of the intellectual
world and of spirit had become the universal
consciousness. Christianity proceeded from Judaism, from
self-conscious abjectness and depression. This feeling
of nothingness has from the beginning characterized
the Jews; a sense of desolation, an abjectness where no
reason was, has possession of their life and consciousness.
This single point has later on, and in its proper time,
become a matter of universal history, and into this element
of the nullity of actuality the whole world has raised itself,
passing out of this principle indeed, but also into the kingdom
of Thought, because that nothingness has transformed
itself into what is positively reconciled. This is a second
creation which came to pass after the first; in it Mind became
aware of itself as I&nbsp;=&nbsp;I, that is, as self-consciousness. This
second creation has first of all appeared in self-consciousness
equally directly in the form of a sensuous world,
in the form of a sensuous consciousness. As much of
the Notion as has entered in was adopted by the Fathers
from the philosophers already mentioned; their Trinity,
in so far as a rational thought, and not a mere ordinary
conception, comes from these, and certain other ideas also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
But what mainly distinguishes them is the fact that for
the Christian this intelligible world had likewise this immediate
sensuous truth of an ordinary course of events—a
form which it must have and retain for the majority of
men.</p>

<p id="c23">3. This new world has therefore, however, to be adopted
by a new race of men, by Barbarians; for it is characteristic
of barbarians to apprehend the spiritual in a sensuous way.
And it must be by northern barbarians, for it is the northern
self-containedness alone that is the immediate principle of
this new world-consciousness. With this self-consciousness
of the intelligible world as a world immediately actual,
mind, having regard to what it has in itself become, is
higher than before, but, on the other side, in respect of its
consciousness it is thrown quite back to the beginning of
culture, and this consciousness had to commence from the
beginning again. What it had to overcome was on the
one hand this sensuous immediacy of its intelligible world,
and secondly the opposed sensuous immediacy of actuality,
by its consciousness held as null. It excludes the sun,
replaces it with tapers, is furnished with images merely;
it is in itself alone, and inward, not reconciled for consciousness—to
self-consciousness a sinful, wicked world
is present. For the intelligible world of Philosophy had
not yet completed in itself the task of making itself the
actual world—of recognizing the intelligible in the actual,
as well as the actual in the intelligible. It is one thing to
have the Idea of Philosophy, to recognize absolute essence
as absolute essence, and quite another thing to recognize
it as the system of the universe, of nature, and of individual
self-consciousness, as the whole development of its
reality. The Neo-Platonists had found that principle of
realization—namely, this real substance which again places
itself in quite opposed, though in themselves real determinations—but
having got so far they did not find the
form, the principle of self-consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Teutonic nations the world-spirit imposed the
task of developing an embryo into the form of the thinking
man. What comes first is the mind as apprehended, and
to that is opposed the subjectivity of will which has not
been taken up into mind; the kingdom of truth and that
of the world are bound together and at the same time
evidently divided. An intelligible world has thus in the
conception of men established itself in the mode of this
same actuality, like a far-away land that is just as really
conceived of by us, peopled and inhabited, as the world we
see, but which is hidden from us as though by a mountain.
It is not the Greek or any other world of gods and of
mythology—a simple, undivided faith; for there is likewise
present in it the highest negativity, that is, the contradiction
between actuality and that other world. This intellectual
world expresses the nature of real absolute existence.
It is on it that Philosophy tries its powers, and on it that
thought also moils and toils. We have in general outline
to deal with these not very pleasing manifestations.</p>

<p>Our first view of Philosophy, as revealed in Christianity (pp.
10-21) is that of a dim groping which is carried on within
the depths of the Idea—as being the forms assumed by the
same, which constitute its moments; we see a hard struggle
made by reason, which cannot force its way out of the
imagination and popular conceptions to the Notion. There
is no venture too rash for the imagination to undertake,
because, impelled by reason, it cannot satisfy itself with
beautiful images, but has to pass beyond them. There is
likewise no extravagance of reason into which it does not
fall, because it cannot obtain the mastery of the image, but
within this element is merely in the act of warfare with it.
Later on than this Western self-immersion, there arose in
the East expansion, negation of all that is concrete,
abstraction from all determinations; this pure contemplation
or pure thought present in Mohammedanism corresponds
to the Christian descent into self. Within Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
itself, however, the intellectual world is set in
opposition to that first Cabalistic principle; in it pure
conceptions rule which constitute the ideas present in
thought, and with this we enter upon the Scholastic
philosophy. Philosophy, like the arts and sciences, when,
through the rule of the Barbarians of Germany, they
became dumb and lifeless, took refuge with the Arabians,
and there attained a wonderful development; they were the
first sources from which the West obtained assistance.
Through the presupposition of the immediately present
and accepted truth, thought had lost its freedom and the
truth its presence in conceiving consciousness; and philosophy
sank into a metaphysics of the understanding and
into a formal dialectic. We have thus in this period first
of all to consider philosophy in the East, and secondly in
the West; that is, the philosophy of the Arabians first, and
subsequently the philosophy of the Schools. The Schoolmen
are the principal figures in this period; they represent
European philosophy in the European Middle Ages. The
third stage is the dissolution of what is upheld in the
scholastic philosophy; new meteor-like apparitions are now
seen, which precede the third period, the genuine revival
of free Philosophy.</p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">Arabian Philosophy</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the West the Germanic tribes had obtained possession
of what had hitherto formed a section of the Roman
Empire, and their conquests were attaining to shape and
solidity, when another religion dawned in the East, namely
the Mohammedan. The East purified itself of all that was
individual and definite, while the West descended into the
depths and actual presence of spirit. As quickly as the
Arabians with their fanaticism spread themselves over the
Eastern and the Western world, so quickly were the various
stages of culture passed through by them, and very shortly
they advanced in culture much farther than the West. For
in Mohammedanism, which quickly reached its culminating
point, both as regards external power and dominion and
also spiritual development, Philosophy, along with all the
other arts and sciences, flourished to an extraordinary
degree, in spite of its here not displaying any specially
characteristic features. Philosophy was fostered and
cherished among the Arabians; the philosophy of the
Arabians must therefore be mentioned in the history of
Philosophy. What we have to say, however, chiefly
concerns the external preservation and propagation of
Philosophy. The Arabians became acquainted with Greek
philosophy mainly through the medium of the Syrians in
Western Asia, who had imbibed Greek culture, and who
were under the Arabian sway. In Syria, which formed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Greek kingdom, at Antioch, especially in Berytus and
Edessa, there were great institutes of learning; and thus
the Syrians constituted the connecting link between Greek
philosophy and the Arabians. Syrian was the language of
the people even in Bagdad.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Moses Maimonides, a learned Jew, gives further historical particulars
in his <i>Doctor Perplexorum</i> of this transition of Philosophy to the
Arabians. He says: “All that the Ishmaelites have written of the unity
of God and other philosophic dogmas”—especially the sect of the Muatzali
(‎‏מעתוזלה‏‎, <i>i.e.</i> the Separated), who were the first to take an
interest in the abstract intellectual knowledge of such subjects, while
the sect Assaria (‎‏האשערייה‏‎) arose later—“is based upon arguments
and propositions which have been taken from the books of the Greeks and
Aramæans” (Syrians), “who strove to refute and deny the teachings of the
philosophers.” The cause of this is as follows: The Christian community
came to include within it these nations also, and the Christians defended
many dogmas which were contradictory of philosophic tenets; among these
nations, however, the teachings of philosophers were very widely and
generally diffused (for with them Philosophy had its origin), and kings
arose who adopted the Christian religion. The Christian Greeks and
learned Aramæans, therefore, when they perceived that their doctrines
were so clearly and plainly refuted by the philosophers, thought out
a wisdom of their own, the “Wisdom of the Words” (Devarim), and they
themselves received on that account the name of the Speakers (Medabberim,
‎‏מִדַבְרִים‏‎). They set up principles which served the purpose both
of confirming their faith and of refuting the opposite teaching of the
philosophers. When the Ishmaelites followed and attained supremacy, and
the books of the philosophers themselves fell into their hands, and along
with them the answers which “Christian Greeks and Aramæans had written
against the philosophic books, as for instance the writings of Johannes
Grammaticus, Aben Adi, and others, they eagerly laid hold of these and
adopted them bodily.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Christians and Ishmaelites felt the same need
of philosophy; the Ishmaelites, moreover, strove all the more eagerly
after knowledge of this kind, because their first desire was to defend
Mohammedanism against Christianity, which was the religion of a large
proportion of the nations they had conquered.</p>

<p>The external sequence of events is this. Syriac
versions of Greek works were to be had, and these were
now translated into Arabic by the Arabians; or translations
were made from the Greek directly into Arabic. In
the reign of Harun al-Raschid several Syrians are named
who lived in Bagdad, and who had been called upon
by the Caliphs to translate these works into Arabic. They
were the first scientific teachers among the Arabians, and
were chiefly physicians; hence the works they translated
were on medicine. Among these translators was Johannes
Mesue of Damascus, who lived in the reigns of Al-Raschid
(<i>d.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 786), Al-Mamun (<i>d.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 833) and Al-Motawakkil
(<i>d.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 847), rather earlier than the rise of the Turks to
supremacy (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 862); he was a hospital superintendent in
Bagdad. Al-Raschid appointed him to make translations
from Syriac into Arabic; he opened a public school for
the study of medicine and all the sciences then known.
Honain was a Christian, as was also his master Johannes,
and belonged to the Arab tribe Ebadi; he applied himself
to the study of Greek, and made a number of translations
into Arabic, and also into Syriac, for example, Nicolaus
<i>De summa philosophiæ Aristotelicæ</i>, Ptolemy, Hippocrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and Galen. Another is Ebn Adda, an eminent
dialectician, who is quoted by Abulfaraj.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Among the
works of the Greek philosophers it was almost exclusively
the writings of Aristotle which were translated by these
Syrians, and the later commentaries on the same. It was
thus not the Arabians themselves who translated the above
works.</p>

<p>In the Arabic philosophy, which shows a free, brilliant
and profound power of imagination, Philosophy and the
sciences took the same bent that they had taken earlier
among the Greeks. Plato with his Ideas or universals laid
the foundation of the independent world of intellect, and
established absolute existence as an existence which is
manifestly present in the mode of thought; Aristotle developed,
completed and peopled the realm of thought; the
Neo-Platonic philosophy reached the further conception of
the intelligible world as Idea of the existence which is independent
in itself, of spirit; and then this first Idea, which
we have already met with in connection with Proclus,
passed over into a similar Aristotelian development and
completion. Consequently it is the Alexandrian or Neo-Platonic
Idea which forms the essential principle or basis
of the Arabian as well as the Scholastic philosophy, and
all that Christian philosophy offers; it is on it that the
determinations of the Notion expend their strength, and
around this that they career. A particular description of
Arabian philosophy has in some parts but little interest;
in other parts it will be found that the main dogmas of
this philosophy have much in common with those of the
Scholastics.</p>

<p>We may say of the Arabians that their philosophy constitutes
no characteristic stage in the development of
philosophy. The principal points in this, as in the later
philosophy, were the question whether the world is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
eternal, and the task of proving the unity of God and
similar dogmas. One great consideration in all this, however,
was to defend the doctrines of Mohammedanism, and
owing to this all philosophizing had to be carried on
within the limits of these doctrines. The Arabians, like
the Christians of the West, were restricted by the dogmas
of their Church (if one may call it so), few though these
dogmas were; yet this last circumstance of the small
number of the dogmas certainly gave them greater liberty.
But according to all that we know of them, they established
no principle of self-conscious reason that was truly higher,
and thus they brought Philosophy no further. They have
no other principle than that of revelation, therefore only
a principle that is external.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c30">A. <span class="smcap">Philosophy of the Medabberim.</span></a></h2>

<p>The Medabberim are specially mentioned by Moses
Maimonides as a widely extended philosophic school or
sect of considerable eminence. He speaks (More Nevochim,
P. I. c. 71, pp. 134, 135) of the peculiarity of their
method of philosophy somewhat as follows: “The Ishmaelites,
however, have extended their discourses still
further, and have aspired to other wonderful doctrines, of
which none of the Greek Medabberim knew anything, because
they were still on some points in agreement with
the philosophers. The main point to be remarked is that
all the Medabberim, whether among the Greeks who had
become Christians, or among the Ishmaelites, in the building
up of their principles did not follow the nature of the
matter itself, or draw their arguments from it, but
only had in view how the subject must be regarded in
order to support their assertion, or at least not to refute
it altogether: afterwards they boldly asserted that these
were the circumstances of the case, and adduced further
arguments and maxims in support of their object. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
insisted on that, and that alone, which concurred with their
opinions, even though it were in the most remote degree,
through a hundred links of reasoning. The earliest of
their learned men adopted this practice, though professing
that they reached these reflections through speculation
alone, without reference to any preconceived opinion.
Their successors did not follow their example,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the pure philosophy of the so-called “Speakers” was
expressed the principle, peculiar to the Oriental mind, of
the dissolution of definite thought in all its consequences as
the dissolution of all connection and relation. Maimonides
says (P. I. c. 71, p. 135; c. 73, p. 149): “The ground-principle
of the Medabberim is that men can have no
certain knowledge of the nature of things, because in the
understanding the contrary may ever exist and be thought.
Besides this they in the majority of instances confound
imagination with understanding, and give to the former
the name of the latter. They adopted as a principle, atoms
and empty space,” where all connection appears as something
contingent. “Production is nothing but a connection
of atoms, and decay nothing but a separation of the same;
and time consists of many ‘nows.’” In this way nothing
but the atom really exists. They have thus in the more
advanced cultivation of thought brought to consciousness
the main standpoint, then as now the standpoint of the
Orientals—that of substance, the one substance. This
pantheism, or Spinozism, if you like to call it so, is thus
the universal view of Oriental poets, historians and philosophers.</p>

<p>The Medabberim go on to say: “Substances, <i>i.e.</i> individuals,
which,” for the rest, “are created by God, have
many accidental qualities, as in snow every particle is
white. But no quality can endure for two moments; as it
comes, it goes again, and God creates another and yet
another in its place.” All determinations are thus fleeting
or perishable; the individual alone is permanent. “If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pleases God to create another quality in a substance, it
continues; but if He ceases to create, the substance
perishes.” Thereby all necessary connection is done away
with, so that Nature has no meaning. “They therefore
deny that anything exists by nature, likewise that the
nature of this or that body necessitates that it should have
certain qualities rather than others. But they say that
God creates all qualities instantaneously, without natural
means and without the help of anything else.” General
permanence is substance, and the particular is altered
every moment, and so exists through the substance.
“According to this principle they say, for instance, that
when we think we have dyed a garment red with red dye
we have not dyed it red at all; for God created the red
colour in the garment at the very moment at which we
thought we had brought about the result with the red dye.
God observes the invariable custom of not permitting that
the colour black should be produced except when the
garment is dyed with that hue; and the first colour which
comes to pass on the occasion of the connection is not permanent,
but disappears on the instant, and every moment
another appears which is created in its turn. In the same
way knowledge also is an accident, which is created by
God at every moment that I know anything; to-day we
no longer possess the knowledge which we yesterday
possessed. A man,” when writing, “does not move the
pen when he thinks he moves it, but the motion is an
accident of the pen, created by God at the moment.” In
this way God alone is in truth the operative cause; but
He might have made everything differently. “Their eighth
proposition is to the effect that nothing but substance or
accident exists, and natural forms are themselves accidents;
substances alone are individuals. The ninth proposition is
that accidents have nothing to do with one another; they
have no causal connection or other relation; in every
substance all accidents may exist. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>The tenth proposition is
transition (‎‏אִפִשָׁרות‏‎, <i>transitus</i>, <i>possibilitas</i>):” “All that
we can fancy may also pass over into the understanding,
<i>i.e.</i> be possible. But in this way everything is possible,”
since there are no laws of the understanding; this transition
of thought is thus perfectly accidental. “A man as
large as a mountain, a flea as large as an elephant, are
possible. Everything may just as well be something else
as what it is, and there is no reason at all why anything
should be one way rather than another. They term it a
mere habit that the earth revolves round a centre-point,
that fire moves upward and that it is hot; it is just as
possible, they say, that fire should be cold.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>We thus see an utter inconstancy of everything; and
this whirl of all things is essentially Oriental. But at the
same time this is certainly also a complete dissolution of all
that pertains to reasonableness, in harmony of course with
Eastern exaltation of spirit, which allows of nothing definite.
God is in Himself the perfectly undefined, His activity is
altogether abstract, and hence the particulars produced
thereby are perfectly contingent; if we speak of the
necessity of things, the term is meaningless and incomprehensible,
and no attempt should be made to comprehend it.
The activity of God is thus represented as perfectly devoid
of reason. This abstract negativity, combined with the
permanent unity, is thus a fundamental conception in the
Oriental way of looking at things. Oriental poets are in a
marked degree pantheists; the pantheistic is their ordinary
point of view. Thus the Arabians developed the sciences
and philosophy, without further defining the concrete Idea;
their work is rather the dissolution of all that is definite in
this substance, with which is associated mere changeableness
as the abstract moment of negativity.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c34">B. <span class="smcap">Commentators of Aristotle.</span></a></h2>

<p>The Arabians, moreover, made a point for the most part
of studying the writings of Aristotle very diligently, and
of availing themselves more especially both of his metaphysical
and logical writings, and also of his <i>Physics</i>;
they occupied themselves particularly with multiplying
commentaries on Aristotle, and developing still further the
abstract logical element there present. Many of these
commentaries are still extant. Works of this kind are
known in the West, and have been even translated into
Latin and printed; but much good is not to be got from
them. The Arabians developed the metaphysics of the
understanding and a formal logic. Some of the famous
Arabians lived as early as the eighth and ninth centuries;
their progress was therefore very rapid, for the West had
as yet made very little advance in culture.</p>

<p>Alkendi, who wrote a commentary on the <i>Logic</i>, flourished
in and about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 800, under Almamun.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Alfarabi died in
966; he wrote commentaries on Aristotle’s <i>Organon</i>, which
were made diligent use of by the Scholastics, and was also
author of a work “On the Origin and Division of the
Sciences.” It is related of him that he read through
Aristotle’s treatise <i>On Hearing</i> forty times, and his
<i>Rhetoric</i> two hundred times, without getting at all tired of
them;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> he must have had a good stomach. The very
physicians made a study of philosophy, and formulated
theories; among them was Avicenna (<i>b.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 984, <i>d.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1064), who belonged to Bokhara, to the east of the Caspian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Sea; he wrote a commentary on Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Algazel
(<i>d.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1127 at Bagdad) wrote compendiums of logic and metaphysics;
he was a sceptic of great ability, with a powerful
mind of the Oriental cast; he held the words of the Prophet
to be pure truth, and wrote <i>Destructio Philosophorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Tofail died in Seville in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1193.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Averroës, who died
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1217, was specially distinguished as the commentator
of Aristotle.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The acquaintance of the Arabians with Aristotle has this
interest in history that it was thus that Aristotle first
became known also in the West. The commentaries on
Aristotle and the collections of passages from his writings
become thus for the Western world a fountain of philosophy.
Western nations long knew nothing of Aristotle, excepting
through such retranslations of his works and translations
of Arabian commentaries on them. For such translations
were made from Arabic into Latin by Spanish Arabs, and
especially by Jews in the south of Spain and Portugal and
in Africa; there was often even a Hebrew translation
between.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c35">C. <span class="smcap">Jewish Philosophers.</span></a></h2>

<p>With the Arabians are closely connected the Jewish
philosophers, among whom the above-mentioned Moses
Maimonides held a distinguished place. He was born at
Cordova, in Spain, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1131 (Anno Mundi 4891, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
according to others, 4895), and lived in Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Besides
<i>More Nevochim</i>, which has been translated into Latin, he
composed other works; of him and other Jews much
more of a literary character might be said. In their philosophy
a strong Cabalistic element, on the one hand,
makes itself felt throughout, in astrology, geomancy,
&amp;c.; on the other hand, we find in Moses Maimonides, as
in the Fathers, that the foundation is laid in history. He
deals with this in a strictly abstract system of metaphysics,
which is connected, in Philo’s fashion, with the Mosaic
books and their interpretation. We find in these Jewish
philosophers proofs brought forward that God is One, that
the world was created, and that matter is not eternal;
Maimonides also speaks of the nature of God. The unity
of God is dealt with as it was among the ancient Eleatics
and the Neo-Platonists; to prove, namely, that not the
Many, but the self-begetting and self-abrogating One is
the truth.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">The Scholastic Philosophy</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">All</span> the Philosophy which we first encounter in the
Middle Ages, when independent states begin to rise, consists
of bare remnants of the Roman world, which on its
Fall had sunk in all respects so low that the culture of the
world seemed to have come entirely to an end. Thus in
the West hardly anything was known beyond the Isagoge
of Porphyry, the Latin Commentaries of Boethius on
the Logical works of Aristotle, and extracts from the
same by Cassiodorus—most barren compilations; there is
also what is just as barren, the dissertations ascribed to
Augustine <i>De dialectica</i> and <i>De categoriis</i>, which last is a
paraphrase of the Aristotelian work upon the categories.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
These were the first make-shifts or expedients for carrying
on Philosophy; in them the most external and most formal
reasoning is applied.</p>

<p>The whole effect of the scholastic philosophy is a monotonous
one. In vain have men hitherto endeavoured to show
in this theology, which reigned from the eighth or even
sixth century almost to the sixteenth, particular distinctions
and stages in development. In this case as in that of
the Arabian philosophy, time does not allow—and if it did
the nature of things would not allow—us to separate
the scholastic philosophy into its individual systems or
manifestations, but only to give a general sketch of
the main elements present therein which it has actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
taken up into thought. It is not interesting by reason of
its matter, for we cannot remain at the consideration of
this; it is not a philosophy. The name, however, properly
speaking indicates a general manner rather than a system—if
we may speak of a philosophic system. Scholasticism
is not a fixed doctrine like Platonism or Scepticism, but a
very indefinite name which comprehends the philosophic
endeavours of Christendom for the greater part of a thousand
years. However, this history which occupies nearly a
thousand years is, as a matter of fact, comprised within one
Notion which we propose to consider more closely; it has
ever occupied the same standpoint, and been grounded on
the same principle; for it is the faith of the Church that
we catch sight of, and a formalism which is merely an
eternal analysis and constant re-iteration within itself. The
more general acceptance of the Aristotelian writings has
merely brought forth a difference of degree and caused no
real scientific progress. Here there is indeed a history of
men, but speaking properly none of scientific knowledge;
the men are noble, pious, and in all respects most distinguished.</p>

<p>The study of the scholastic philosophy is a difficult one,
even if its language only be considered. The Scholastics certainly
make use of a barbaric Latin, but this is not the fault
of the Scholastics but of their Latin culture. Latin forms
a quite unsuitable instrument for applying to philosophic
categories such as these, because the terms which the new
culture adopts could not possibly be expressed by this
language without unduly straining it; the beautiful Latin
of Cicero is not adapted for use in profound speculations.
It cannot be expected of anyone to know at first hand this
philosophy of the Middle Ages, for it is as comprehensive
and voluminous as it is barren and ill-expressed.</p>

<p>Of the great schoolmen we still have many works left
to us which are very lengthy, so that it is no easy task to
study them: the later they are, the more formal do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
become. The Schoolmen did not only write compendiums—for
the writings of Duns Scotus amount to twelve, and
those of Thomas Aquinas to eighteen folios. Abstracts of
them are to be found in various works. The principal
sources from which we obtain our knowledge are: 1,
Lambertus Danæus in the Prolegomena to his <i>Commentarius
in librum primum sententiarum Petri Lombardi,
Genevæ</i>, 1580. (This is the best authority we have in
abridged form); 2, Launoi: <i>De varia Aristotelis in Academia
Parisiensi fortuna</i>; 3, Cramer: Continuation of
Bossuet’s History of the World, in the last two volumes;
4, the <i>Summa</i> of Thomas Aquinas. In Tiedemann’s History
of Philosophy extracts from the Scholastics are also to
be found, as likewise in Tennemann; Rixner also makes
judicious extracts.</p>

<p>We shall limit ourselves to general points of view. The
name finds its origin in this way. From the time of Charles
the Great it was only in two places—in the great schools
attached to the great cathedral churches and monasteries—that
a cleric, that is a canon who had the oversight of
the instructors (<i>informatores</i>), was called <i>scholasticus</i>; he
likewise gave lectures on the most important branch of
science, theology. In the monasteries he who was the most
advanced instructed the monks. We have not, properly
speaking, to deal with these; but although scholastic
philosophy was something altogether different, the name of
Scholastics attached itself to those alone who propounded
their theology scientifically and in a system. In place of
the <i>patres ecclesiæ</i> there thus arose later on the <i>doctores</i>.</p>

<p>The scholastic philosophy is thus really theology, and
this theology is nothing but philosophy. The further content
of theology is merely that which is present in the
ordinary conceptions of religion; theology, however, is the
science of the system as it must necessarily be present
within every Christian, every peasant, &amp;c. The science of
theology is often placed in an external historical content, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
exegesis, in the enumeration of the various manuscripts of
the New Testament, in considering whether these are written
on parchment, cotton fabrics or paper, whether in uncial
letters or otherwise, and which century they belong to;
further matters for consideration are the Jewish conceptions
of time, the history of the Popes, Bishops and
Fathers, and what took place at the councils of the Church.
All these matters, however, do not pertain to the nature of
God and its relation to mankind. The one essential object
of theology as the doctrine of God, is the nature of God,
and this content is in its nature really speculative; those
theologians who consider this are therefore nothing less
than philosophers. The science of God is nothing but
Philosophy. Philosophy and theology have hence here also
been counted one, and it is their separation that constitutes
the transition into modern times, seeing that men
have thought that for thinking reason something could be
true which is not true for theology. Down to the Middle
Ages, on the contrary, it was held as fundamental that
there should be but one truth. Thus the theology of the
scholastics is not to be represented as though, as with us, it
merely contained doctrines about God, &amp;c., in historic guise,
for in fact it also has within it the profoundest speculations
of Aristotle and of the Neo-Platonists. Their philosophy,
and much in them that is excellent, is found in Aristotle,
only in a simpler and purer form; and to them too the
whole lay beyond actuality and mingled with Christian
actuality as it is represented to us.</p>

<p>From Christianity, within whose bounds we now have our
place, Philosophy has to re-establish its position. In
heathendom the root of knowledge was external nature
as thought devoid of self, and subjective nature as the
inward self. Both Nature and the natural self of mankind,
and likewise thought, there possessed affirmative significance;
hence all this was good. In Christianity the root
of truth has, however, quite another meaning; it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
only the truth as against the heathen gods, but as against
Philosophy also, against nature, against the immediate consciousness
of man. Nature is there no longer good, but
merely a negative; self-consciousness, the thought of man,
his pure self, all this receives a negative position in Christianity.
Nature has no validity, and affords no interest;
its universal laws, as the reality under which the individual
existences of nature are collected, have likewise no authority:
the heavens, the sun, the whole of nature is a corpse. Nature
is given over to the spiritual, and indeed to spiritual subjectivity;
thus the course of nature is everywhere broken
in upon by miracles. With this surrender of natural necessity
we have the fact associated that all further content, all
that truth which constitutes the universal of that nature, is
given and revealed. The one starting-point, the contemplation
of nature, is thus for knowledge undoubtedly not
present. Then this fact is likewise set aside that I am
present as a self. The self as this immediate certainty has
to be abrogated; it must also merge itself in another self,
but in one beyond, and only there does it have its value.
This other self, in which the proper self is made to have its
freedom, is first of all likewise a particular self, that has
not the form of universality: it is determined and limited
in time and space, and at the same time has the significance
of an absolute in and for itself. A real sense of self is thus
abandoned, but what self-consciousness on the other hand
gains is not a universal, a thought. In thought I have real
affirmative significance, not as an individual, but as universal
‘I’; the content of truth is now, however, plainly
individualized, and thus the thought of the ‘I’ falls away.
Thereby, however, the highest concrete content of the absolute
Idea is set forth, in which the opposites that are plainly
infinite are united; it is the power which unites in itself
what appears to consciousness infinitely removed from one
another—the mortal and the absolute. This absolute is
itself ‘this’ first of all as this concrete, not as abstraction, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
as the unity of universal and individual; this concrete consciousness
is for the first time truth. The reason of the
former content being also true, comes to me as something not
pertaining to myself, but as a thing received outside of self.
The testimony of spirit, indeed, pertains thereto, and my
inmost self is present there; but the testimony of spirit is
a thing concealed, which does not further reveal itself, does
not beget the content from itself, but receives it. The
Spirit which bears witness is further itself distinguished
from me as an individual; my testifying spirit is another,
and there only remains to me the empty shell of passivity.
Conditioned by this inflexible standpoint, Philosophy had to
go forth once more. The first working up of this content,
the inward operation of universal thought in the same, is the
task scholastic philosophy has to undertake. The opposition
between faith and reason forms the end arrived at;
reason, on the one hand, feels the necessity of setting to
work on nature in order to obtain immediate certainty, and
on the other hand of finding in genuine thought, in specific
production out of self, this same satisfaction.</p>

<p>We must now speak of the methods and manners of the
scholastics. In this scholastic activity thought pursues its
work quite apart from all regard to experience; we no
longer hear anything of taking up actuality and determining
it through thought. Although the Notion came into recognition
earlier than this, in Aristotle, in the first place, the
Notion was not apprehended as the necessity of carrying
the content further; for this was received in its successive
manifestations, and there was present merely an intermingling
of actuality accepted as truth and of thought.
Still less, in the second place, was the greater part
of the content permeated by Notions, for this content
was taken up superficially into the form of thought—more
especially with the Stoics and Epicureans. The scholastic
philosophy altogether dissociates itself from any such
endeavours; it leaves actuality to exist alongside itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
as if it were despised and had no interest. For reason
found its true existence, its actualization, in another world
and not in this; the whole progress of the cultivated
world goes, however, to the re-instalment of a faith in the
present world. Nevertheless, at first all knowledge and
action, and whatever relates to an interest in this world,
were entirely banished. Branches of knowledge that
pertain to such ordinary matters as sight and hearing, restful
contemplation and occupation with ordinary actuality
here found no place; nor did such sciences as recognize a
definite sphere of actuality after their own particular
fashion, and constitute the material for genuine philosophy,
nor arts which give to the Idea a sensuous existence.
Likewise law and right, the recognition of the actual man,
were not esteemed as pertaining to the social relationships of
life, but to some other sphere. In this absence of rationality
in the actual, or of rationality which has its actuality in
ordinary existence, is found the utter barbarism of thought,
in that it keeps to another world, and does not have the
Notion of reason—the Notion that the certainty of self is
all truth.</p>

<p>Now thought as sundered has a content, the intelligible
world, as an actuality existent for itself, to which thought
applies itself. Its conduct is here to be compared with
that which takes place when the understanding applies
itself to the sensuous and perceptible world, makes it as
substance its basis, having a fixed object in it, and reasoning
respecting it; it is then not the independent movement of
Philosophy proper which penetrates existence and expresses
it, for all it does is to find predicates regarding it. The
scholastic philosophy has thus the intelligible world of
the Christian religion, God and all His attributes and
works therewith connected, as an independent object; and
thought is directed to God’s unchangeableness, to such
questions as whether matter is eternal, whether man is free,
&amp;c.—just as the understanding passes to and fro over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
phenomenal and perceived. Now the scholastic philosophy
was here given over to the infinite movement of determinate
Notions; the categories of possibility and actuality,
freedom and necessity, constitution and substance, &amp;c., are
of this nature, they are not fixed, but pure movements.
Anything whatever, determined as potential, transforms
itself equally into the opposite, and must necessarily be
surrendered; and determination can only save itself by a
new distinction, because it must, on the one hand, be given
up, and on the other retained. The scholastics are thus
decried on account of the endless distinctions which they
draw. For the sake of these determinations through the
abstract Notion the Aristotelian philosophy was predominant,
though not in its whole extent. It was the Aristotelian
<i>Organon</i> that was held in such favour, and that indeed just
as much for its laws of thought as for its metaphysical conceptions—the
categories. These abstract Notions constituted
in their determinateness the understanding of the
scholastic philosophy, which could not pass beyond itself
and attain to freedom, nor seize upon the freedom given by
reason.</p>

<p>With this finite form a finite content is likewise directly
associated. From one determination we pass on to another,
and such determinations, as particular, are finite; the determination
there relates itself externally and not as self-comprehensive
and self-embracing. The result of this
determination is that thought will really act as if it
brought about conclusions, for to draw conclusions is the
mode of formal logical progression. Philosophy thus consists
of a methodical and syllogistic reasoning. Just as the
Sophists of Greece wandered about amongst abstract conceptions
on behalf of actuality, so did the scholastics on
behalf of their intellectual world. To the former Being
had validity; it they had rescued and delivered as against
the negativity of the Notion, while along with that they had
justified it through the same. The principal endeavour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the scholastics was in the same way to vindicate the Christian
intellectual world as against the confusion of the Notion,
and through the latter to demonstrate its conformity with
the same. The universal form of the scholastic philosophy
thus consisted in this—that a proposition was laid down,
the objections to it brought forward, and these contradicted
through counter-propositions and distinctions. Philosophy
was hence not separated from theology, as it is not in itself,
for Philosophy is the knowledge of absolute existence, that
is to say, theology. But to that theology the Christian
absolute world was a system which was held to be an
actuality, as was ordinary actuality for the Greek sophists.
Of Philosophy proper there thus remained only the laws of
thought and abstractions.</p>

<h2><a id="c45">A. <span class="smcap">Relationship of the Scholastic Philosophy to
Christianity.</span></a></h2>

<p>Philosophy with the scholastics had consequently the same
quality of want of independence as it had before this with
the Christian Fathers and the Arabians. The Church as
already constituted established itself amongst the Teutonic
nations, and through its constitution it conditioned philosophy.
The Christian Church had indeed spread itself abroad
throughout the Roman world, but, more especially in the
beginning, it merely formed a community of its own, by whom
the world was renounced, and which made no special claims
to recognition—or if such claims were made they were merely
negative, because the individuals in the world were simply
martyrs, thus renouncing the world. But the Church in
time became dominant, and the Roman emperors, both of
the East and of the West, embraced Christianity. Thus the
Church attained to a position openly recognized and undisturbed,
from which it exercised much influence upon the
world. The political world, however, fell into the hands of
the Teutonic nations, and thereby a new form arose, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
this the scholastic philosophy pertains. We know the
revolution by the name of the Migration of the Nations
(<i>supra</i>, pp. 23, 24). Fresh races inundated the ancient
Roman world and established themselves therein; they
thus erected their new world on the ruins of the old—a
picture which Rome in its present aspect still presents.
There the splendour of the Christian temples is due in part
to the remnants of the ancient, and new palaces are built
on ruins and have ruins all around.</p>

<p>1. The principal feature in the Middle Ages is found in
this disunion, the two sides here present; there are revealed
in it two nations, two manners of speech. We see people
who have hitherto ruled, a previous world having its own
language, arts, and sciences, and on this to them foreign
element the new nations grafted themselves, and these thus
started upon their course internally dissevered. In this
history we have thus before us not the development of a
nation from itself, but one proceeding from its opposite,
and one which is and remains burdened by this opposite,
and which takes it up into itself and has to overcome it.
Hence these people have in this way represented in themselves
the nature of the spiritual process. Spirit is the
making for itself a presupposition, the giving to itself the
natural as a counterpoise, the separating itself therefrom,
thus the making it an object, and then for the first time
the working upon this hypothesis, formulating it, and from
itself bringing it forth, begetting it, internally reconstructing
it. Hence in the Roman as in the Byzantine world,
Christianity has triumphed as a Church; but neither of
these worlds was capable of effectuating the new religion
in itself and of bringing forth a new world from this
principle. For in both there was a character already
present—customs, laws, a juridical system, a constitution
(if it can be called constitution), a political condition,
capacities, art, science, spiritual culture—in short, everything
was there. The nature of spirit, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
requires that the world thus constituted should be
begotten from it, and that this process of begetting
should take place through the agency of reaction,
through the assimilation of something which has gone
before. These conquerors have thus established themselves
in a foreign sphere, and have become the rulers over it;
but at the same time they have come under the dominion
of a new spirit which has been imposed upon them.
Although on the one hand predominant, on the other they
have come under the dominion of the spiritual element,
because they conducted themselves passively in regard
to it.</p>

<p>The spiritual Idea or spirituality has become imposed
upon the dulness, both in mind and spirit, of these rough
barbarians; their hearts were thereby pricked. The rough
nature has in this way become immanent in the Idea as
an eternal opposition, or there is kindled in them infinite
pain, the most terrible suffering—such that it may even be
represented as a crucified Christ. They had to sustain this
conflict within themselves, and one side of it is found in
the philosophy which later on made its appearance amongst
them, and was first of all received as something given.
They are still uncultured people, but for all their barbaric
dulness they are deep in heart and mind; on them, then,
has the principle of mind been bestowed, and along with it
this pain, this war between spiritual and natural, has necessarily
been instituted. Culture here begins from the most
terrible contradiction, and this has to be by it resolved.
It is a kingdom of pain, but of purgatory, for that which is
in the pain is spirit and not animal, and spirit does not die,
but goes forth from its grave. The two sides of this contradiction
are really thus related to one another in such a
way that it is the spiritual which has to reign over the
barbarians.</p>

<p>The true dominion of spirit cannot, however, be a dominion
in the sense that its opposite is in subjection to it; spirit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and for itself cannot have the subjective spirit to which it
relates confronting it as an externally obedient slave, for this
last is itself also spirit. The dominion that exists must take up
this position, that spirit is in subjective spirit in harmony
with itself. The universal is thus that opposition in which
the one can only have supremacy by the subjection of the
other, but which already contains the principle of resolution
in itself because mind must necessarily bear rule.
And hence the consequent development is only this, that
mind as reconciliation attains the mastery. To this it pertains
that not the subjective consciousness, mind and heart
alone, but also the worldly rule, laws, institutions, the human
life, in so far as these rest in mind, must become rational.
In the Republic of Plato we have met with the idea that the
philosophers are those who ought to reign. Now is the time
in which it is said that the spiritual are to govern, but this
talk about the spiritual has been made to bear the significance
that ecclesiasticism and the ecclesiastics ought to
govern. The spiritual is thus made a particular form, an
individual, but the real meaning that it bears is that the
spiritual as such ought to be the determining factor; and
this has passed current until the present day. Thus in the
French Revolution we see that abstract thought is made
to rule; in accordance with it constitution and laws are
determined, it forms the bond between man and man;
and men come to have the consciousness that what is
esteemed amongst them is abstract thought, and that liberty
and equality are what ought to be regarded; in this the
subject also has his real value, even in relation to actuality.</p>

<p>One form of this reconciliation is likewise this, that the
subject is satisfied with himself and in himself as he stands
and moves, with his thoughts, his desires, with his
spirituality; and thus that his knowledge, his thought, his
conviction, has come to be the highest, and has the determination
of the divine, of what holds good as absolute. The
divine and spiritual is thus implanted in my subjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
spirit, is identical with me; I myself am the universal, and
it has efficacy for me only as I directly know it. This form
of reconciliation is the newest, but the most one-sided.
For the spiritual is not there determined as objective, but is
only comprehended as it is in my subjectivity, in my consciousness:
my conviction as such is taken as ultimate, and
that is the formal reconciliation of subjectivity with itself.
If the reconciliation has this form, the point of view of
which we spoke before has no longer any interest; it is
past and a mere matter of history. If the conviction as it
immediately reveals itself within every subject is the true,
the absolute, this process of mediation between God, as the
true and absolute, and mankind, is no longer in us a
necessity. The doctrines of the Christian religion have
likewise the position of something foreign, pertaining to a
particular time, that with which certain men have occupied
themselves. The conception that the Idea is absolutely
concrete, and is as spirit in a relation of opposition to the
subject, has disappeared, and only shows itself as having
passed away. In so far that which I have said about the
principle of the Christian system, and shall still say of the
scholastics, has interest only from the standpoint which I
have given, when the interest is in the Idea in its concrete
determination, and not from the standpoint of the immediate
reconciliation of the subject with himself.</p>

<p>2. We have now to consider further the character of the
opposition to any agreement with Philosophy; and to do
this we must shortly call to mind the historical aspect of
the case, although we need only treat of the main points
therein. The first matter to consider is the opposition
that exists in the world. This form of opposition as it
appears in history is as follows. Spirituality as such
should be the spirituality of the heart; spirit, however, is
one, and thus the communion of those who have this
spirituality is asserted. Hence a community arises, which
then becomes an external order, and thus, as we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
(pp. 21, 22), expands into a church. In as far as spirit is its
principle, it is, as spiritual, immediately universal, for
isolation in feeling, opinion, &amp;c., is unspiritual. The Church
organizes itself, but yet it goes forth into worldly existence,
attains to riches, possesses goods, and even becomes worldly
and imbued with all the brute passions; for the spiritual is
merely the original principle. The heart that is set on ordinary
existence, on the world, and the whole of such human
relationships as are hereby involved, is guided by these inclinations,
desires and passions, by all this grossness and
vulgarity. Thus the Church merely has the spiritual
principle within itself without its being truly real, and in
such a way that its further relationships are not yet
rational; for such is their character before the development
of the spiritual principle in the world. The worldly
element without being conformable to the spiritual,
is present as existence, and is the immediately natural
worldly element; in this way the Church comes to have in
itself the immediately natural principle. All the passions
it has within itself—arrogance, avarice, violence, deceit,
rapacity, murder, envy, hatred—all these sins of barbarism
are present in it, and indeed they belong to its scheme
of government. This government is thus already a rule
of passion, although it professes to be a spiritual rule, and
thus the Church is for the most part wrong in its worldly
principles, though right in its spiritual aspect.</p>

<p>Hence the new religion separated our whole conception
of the world into two different worlds, the intellectual
but not subjectively conceived world, and the temporal
world. Therefore life as a whole fell into two parts, two
kingdoms. Directly opposite the spiritual worldly kingdom
there stands the independent worldly kingdom, emperor
against pope, papacy and Church—not a state, but a worldly
government; there the world beyond, here the world beside
us. Two absolutely essential principles conflict with one
another; the rude ways of the world, the ruggedness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the individual will, beget an opposition most terrible and
severe. The culture which now begins to show itself is
confronted by this incomplete reality, as an actual world in
opposition to its world of thought; and it does not
recognize the one as present in the other. It possesses
two establishments, two standards of measure and of weight,
and these it does not bring together but leaves mutually
estranged.</p>

<p>The spiritual kingdom likewise has as Church an immediate
present of ordinary actuality, but the worldly
kingdom, both as external nature and as the real self of
consciousness, has no truth or value in itself; for truth, as
lying beyond it—the measure of truth that shines in
it—is given to it from without as something inconceivable
and in itself complete. The worldly kingdom
must thus be subject to the spiritual become worldly; the
emperor is hence defender and protector of the Church
(<i>advocatus ecclesiæ</i>). The worldly element, in a certain
sense, takes up a position of independence, no doubt, but
it is still in unity with the other in such a way that it
recognizes the spiritual as dominant. In this opposition a
war must arise both on account of the worldly element
which is present in the Church itself, and likewise on account
of the directly worldly element of violence and of barbarism
in worldly rule as it exists <i>per se</i>. The war must at
first, however, prove disastrous to the worldly side, for just
as its own position is asserted, the other is likewise recognized
by it, and it is forced humbly to submit to this last,
to the spiritual and its passions. The bravest, noblest
emperors have been excommunicated by popes, cardinals,
legates, and even by archbishops and bishops; and they
could do nothing in self-defence, nor put their trust in outward
power, for it was internally broken; and thus they
were ever vanquished and finally forced to surrender.</p>

<p>In the second place, as regards morality in the individual,
we see on the one hand religion in its truly noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
attractive form in a few isolated individuals alone. I refer
to those solitary spirits who are dead to the world and far
removed therefrom, who find in their emotions what
satisfies them, and, living in a little circle, can limit themselves
to the sphere of religion. This is the case with
women in the Middle Ages, or with the monks or other
solitaries who were able to preserve themselves in a restricted
and contracted state of fervour such as this, in which the
spiritual side makes itself infinitely felt, although it lacks
actuality. The one truth stood isolated and alone in man,
the whole actuality of mind was not yet penetrated by it.
On the other hand it is, however, essential that mind as
will, impulse and passion, should demand quite another
position, another mode of venting and realizing itself, than
any such solitary and contracted sphere affords, that the
world should require a more extended sphere of existence,
an actual association of individuals, reason and thought
coming together in actual relations and actions. This circle
in which mind is realized—the human life—is, however, at
first separated from the spiritual region of truth. Subjective
virtue partakes more of the character of suffering and
privation on its own account, morality is just this renunciation
and self-surrender, and virtue as regards others merely
has the character of benevolence, a fleeting, accidental
character destitute of relation. All that pertains to
actuality is hence not perfected by the truth, which remains
a heavenly truth alone, a Beyond. Actuality, the earthly
element, is consequently God-forsaken and hence arbitrary;
a few isolated individuals are holy, and the others are not
holy. In these others we first see the holiness of a
moment in the quarter of an hour of worship, and then
for weeks a life of rudest selfishness and violence and the
most ruthless passion. Individuals fall from one extreme
into another, from the extreme of rude excess, lawlessness,
barbarism, and self-will, into the renunciation
of all things without exception, the conquest of all
desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The great army of the Crusaders gives us the best example
of this. They march forth on a holy errand, but on
the way they give free vent to all the passions, and in this
the leaders show the example; the individuals allow themselves
to fall into violence and heinous sin. Their march
accomplished, though with an utter lack of judgment and
forethought, and with the loss of thousands on the way,
Jerusalem is reached: it is beautiful when Jerusalem comes
in view to see them all doing penance in contrition of
heart, falling on their faces and reverently adoring. But
this is only a moment which follows upon months of frenzy,
foolishness and grossness, which everywhere displayed
itself on their march. Animated by the loftiest bravery,
they go on to storm and conquer the sacred citadel, and
then they bathe themselves in blood, revel in endless
cruelties, and rage with a brutal ferocity. From this they
again pass on to contrition and penance; then they get up
from their knees reconciled and sanctified, and once more
they give themselves up to all the littleness of miserable
passions, of selfishness and envy, of avarice and cupidity:
their energies are directed to the satisfaction of their lusts,
and they bring to nought the fair possession that their
bravery had won. This comes to pass because the principle
is only present in them in its implicitude as an abstract
principle, and the actuality of man is not as yet spiritually
formed and fashioned. This is the manner in which the
opposition in actuality manifests itself.</p>

<p>In the third place, we reach the opposition existing in the
content of religion, in the religious consciousness; this has
many forms, though we have here only to call to mind those
that are most inward. On the one hand, we have the Idea
of God—that He is known as the Trinity; on the other,
we have worship, <i>i.e.</i> the process of individuals making
themselves conformable to spirit, to God, and reaching the
certainty of entering the kingdom of God. A present and
actual church is an actuality of the kingdom of God upon
earth, in such a way that this last is present for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
man—every individual lives and must live in the kingdom
of God. In this disposition we have the reconciliation of
every individual; thereby each becomes a citizen of this
kingdom, and participates in the enjoyment of this certainty.
But this reconciliation is allied to the fact that in Christ
the unity of the divine and human nature is shown forth,
that is to say, the way in which the spirit of God must be
present in man. This Christ thus cannot be one who is
past and gone, and the life of reconciliation cannot be a
mere recollection of that past. For as the just behold
Christ in heaven, so must Christ be an object on earth
which may likewise be beheld. In that case this process
must be present—the individual must be united to this
to him objective form, and it becomes identical with
him; the history of Christ, that God reveals Himself
as man, sacrifices Himself, and through this sacrifice
raises Himself to the right hand of God, is in the individual
always being accomplished in the culminating point which
is called the sacrifice of the mass. The mediating element
to which the individual relates himself in worship, is
ever present in the mass as the objective of which the
individual must be made to partake, as the Host and the
act of partaking of the same. This Host, on the one hand,
as objective, is held to be divine, and, on the other, it is
in form an unspiritual and external thing. But that is the
lowest depth of externality reached in the Church; for in
this perfect externality it is before the thing that the knee
must be bowed, and not in as far as it is an object that may
be partaken of. Luther changed this way of regarding
matters; in what is called the Supper, he has retained the
mystical fact that the subject receives the divine element
into himself; but he maintains that it is only divine in so
far as it is partaken of in this subjective spirituality of
faith, and ceases to be an external thing. But in the
Church of the Middle Ages, in the Catholic Church
generally, the Host is honoured even as an external thing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
thus if a mouse eats of the Host, both it and its excrements
are reverenced; there the divine element has altogether
the form of externality. This is the central point of intense
opposition which is on the one hand dissolved, and on the
other remains in perfect contradiction, so that the Host,
still held to be a merely external thing, must nevertheless
be thus high and absolute.</p>

<p>With this externality the other side is connected—the
consciousness of this relation—and here we then have the
consciousness of what is spiritual, of what is the truth,
in the possession of a priesthood. Thus as thing it is
naturally also in the possession of another, from whom,
since it is something distinguished by itself, it has to receive
its distinction—or it must be consecrated—and this last is
likewise an external action only, performed by individuals.
The power to give this distinction to the thing is in the
possession of the Church; from the Church the laity receive
it.</p>

<p>But besides all this, the relationship of the subject in himself,
the fact that he belongs to the Church and is a true
member of the same, must be considered. After the
admission of individuals into the Church their participation
therein must likewise be brought about—that is, their
purification from sin. To this it is, however, essential, in
the first place, that it should be known what evil is, and
secondly, that the individual should desire the good and
that pertaining to religion; and thirdly, that sin should be
committed from an innate and natural sinfulness. Now
since what is inward, or conscience, must be of a right nature,
the sins that are committed must be removed, and made as
though they had not happened; man must ever be purified,
baptized anew, so to speak, and received back again: the
negation that shuts him out must ever be removed. Against
this sinfulness positive commands and laws are now given,
so that from the nature of spirit men cannot know what is
good and evil. Thus the divine law is an external, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
must hence be in someone’s possession; and priests are separated
from others, so that they are exclusively acquainted
both with the particular details of doctrine and the means
of grace, <i>i.e.</i> the mode whereby the individual is religious
in his worship and comes to know that he participates
in the divine. In the same way that the administration
of the means of grace belongs as an outward possession
to the Church in relation to worship, so is the Church also
in possession of a moral estimate for judging of the actions
of individuals; it is in the possession of the conscience, as
of knowledge as a whole, so that man’s inmost essence, his
accountability, passes into other hands and to another person,
and the subject is devoid of individuality even in his
inmost self. The Church also knows what the individual
ought to do; his faults must be known, and another, the
Church, knows them; the sins must be taken away, and
this also is effected in an external way, through purchase,
fasting and stripes, through journeyings, pilgrimages, &amp;c.
Now this is a relation of self-suppression, unspirituality and
deadness both of knowledge and will, in the highest things
as well as in the most trivial actions.</p>

<p>These are the main facts as regards externality in religion
itself, on which all further determinations depend.</p>

<p>3. We have now obtained a better idea of the elements
present in this philosophy; but in barbaric nations
Christianity could have this form of externality alone,
and this pertains to history. For the dulness and
frightful barbarism of such nations must be met by
servitude, and through this service must their education
be accomplished. Man serves under this yoke; this
fearful discipline had to be gone through if the Teutonic
nations were to be raised into spiritual life. But this severe
and wearisome service has an end, an object; infinite spring
and infinite elasticity, the freedom of spirit, is the prize.
The Indians are in equal servitude, but they are irrevocably
lost—identified and identical with nature, yet in themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
opposed to nature. Knowledge is thus limited to the
Church, but in this very knowledge a positive authority is
firmly rooted, and it is a prominent feature of this philosophy,
whose first quality is consequently that of lack of
freedom. Thought thus does not appear as though it proceeded
from itself and was grounded in itself, but as being
really independent of self and depending on a given content,
the doctrine of the Church—which, although speculative
itself, also contains the mode of the immediate existence of
external objects.</p>

<p>In theological form it may be said that, in general, the
Middle Ages signify the dominion of the Son and not of
Spirit; for this last is still in the possession of the priesthood.
The Son has differentiated Himself from the Father,
and is regarded as remaining in this differentiation, so that
the Father in Him is only implicit; but in the unity of both
we first reach Spirit, the Son as Love. If we remain a
moment too long in the difference without likewise asserting
the identity, the Son is the Other; and in this we find the
Middle Ages defined and characterized. The character of
Philosophy in the Middle Ages is thus in the second place
an attempt to think, to conceive, to philosophize under the
burden of absolute hypotheses; for it is not the thinking
Idea in its freedom, but set forth in the form of an externality.
We thus find here in Philosophy the same character
as is present in the general condition of things, and for
this reason I before called to mind the concrete character
that prevails; for on every period of time one special
characteristic is always imprinted. The philosophy of the
Middle Ages thus contains the Christian principle, which
is the highest incentive to thought, because the Ideas
therein present are thoroughly speculative. Of this one
side is that the Idea is grasped by the heart, if we call the
individual man the heart. The identity of the immediate
individuality with the Idea rests in this, that the Son, the
mediator, is known as <i>this</i> man; this is the identity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
spirit with God for the heart as such. But the connection
itself, since it is likewise a connection with God in God, is
hence immediately mystical and speculative; thus here
there is the call to thought which was first of all responded
to by the Fathers, and then by the scholastics.</p>

<p>But since, in the third place, there exists the opposition
between the doctrine of the Church and the worldly man—who
has indeed through thought worked his way out of this
same barbarism, but who in his healthy human understanding
has not yet penetrated to reason—the mode in which
Philosophy was treated at this time for the setting forth of
formal thought, has still no concrete content. We may
appeal to the human concrete mind; in it we have a living
present as thinking and feeling; a concrete content such
as this has its root in the thought of man, and constitutes
the material for his independent consciousness. Formal
thought directs its course by this; the wanderings of abstract
reflection have in such consciousness an aim, which
sets a limit upon them, and leads them back to a human
concrete. But the reflections of the scholastics on such a
content depend unsupported on the determinations of
formal thought, on formal conclusions; and all the determinations
regarding natural relationships, laws of nature,
&amp;c., that may issue, receive as yet no sustenance from experience;
they are not yet determined by the healthy
human understanding. In this respect the content likewise
is unspiritual, and these unspiritual relationships are
inverted and carried into the spiritual in so far as advance
is made to determinateness of a higher kind. These three
points constitute the main characteristics of this philosophy.</p>

<p>More particularly we would shortly deal with the chief
representatives of this philosophy. Scholastic philosophy
is considered to begin with John Scotus Erigena who
flourished about the year 860, and who must not be confused
with the Duns Scotus of a later date. We do not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
know whether he belonged to Ireland or to Scotland, for
Scotus points to Scotland, and Erigena to Ireland. With
him true philosophy first begins, and his philosophy
in the main coincides with the idealism of the Neo-Platonists.
Here and there stray works of Aristotle
were likewise known, even to John Scotus, but the
knowledge of Greek was very limited and rare. He
shows some knowledge of the Greek and Hebrew tongues,
and even of Arabic as well; but we do not know how he
attained to this. He also translated from Greek to Latin
writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, a later Greek philosopher
of the Alexandrian school, who more especially followed
Proclus: namely, <i>De cœlesti hierarchia</i>, and others which
Brucker calls (Hist. crit. phil. T. III. p. 521), <i>nugæ et
deliria Platonica</i>. Michael Balbus, Emperor of Constantinople,
had in the year 824 made a present of these works to
the Emperor Louis the Pious; Charles the Bald caused them
to be translated by Scotus, who long resided at his court.
In this way something of the Alexandrian philosophy became
known in the West. The Pope quarrelled with Charles,
and complained to him of the translator, against whom he
made the reproach that “he should have first sent the book
to him in conformity with the general usage, and asked
his approval.” John Scotus afterwards lived in England
as head of a school at Oxford, which had been founded by
King Alfred.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Scotus was also the author of some original works, which
are not without depth and penetration, upon nature and its
various orders (<i>De naturæ divisione</i>), &amp;c. Dr. Hjort, of
Copenhagen, published an epitome of the writings of Scotus
Erigena, in 1823. Scotus Erigena sets to work philosophically,
expressing himself in the manner of the Neo-Platonists,
and not freely, and as from himself. Thus in the method
of expression adopted by Plato, and also by Aristotle, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are rejoiced to find a new conception, and on bringing it
to the test of philosophy, to find it both correct and profound;
but here everything is ready to hand, cut and dry.
Yet, with Scotus, theology is not yet built on exegesis, and
on the authority of the Church; the Church in many cases
rejected his writings. Thus Scotus is reproached by a Lyons
church council in these words: “There have come to us the
writings of a boastful, chattering man, who disputes about
divine providence and predestination, in human fashion, or,
as he himself boasts, with philosophic arguments, and without
relying on the holy scriptures and bringing forward the
authority of the Fathers. And he dares to defend this on
its own merit, and to establish it on its own laws, without
submitting himself to the holy scriptures and the authority
of the Fathers.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Scotus Erigena hence even said:
“The true Philosophy is the true Religion, and the true
Religion is the true Philosophy.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The separation came
later on. Scotus then made a beginning, but properly he
does not belong to the scholastics.</p>

<h2><a id="c60">B. <span class="smcap">General Historical Points of View.</span></a></h2>

<p>All further scholastic philosophy attaches itself more to
the doctrines of the Christian Church; the ecclesiastical
system which it thereby made its necessary basis, became
early established through church councils, while the faith
of the Evangelical Church already prevailed before the time
of these councils from which the Catholic Church derives
its support. The most important and most interesting
thoughts which pertain to the scholastics, are, on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hand, the strife between nominalism and realism; and, on
the other, the proof of the existence of God—quite a new
manifestation.</p>

<h3><a id="c61a">1. <span class="smcap">The Building Up of Dogmas on Metaphysical Grounds.</span></a></h3>

<p>The efforts of the scholastics were further directed, firstly,
to the building up of the dogmas of the Christian Church on
metaphysical bases. After this, the collected doctrines of
the Church were systematically treated. Then the scholastics
had branches or modifications of these dogmas, which
were not determined by the doctrinal system. Those
grounds themselves, and then these further and special
points of view, were objects handed over for free discussion.
Neo-Platonic philosophy was what lay before the theologians
first of all; the manner of this school is recognized
in the older and purer scholastics. Anselm and Abelard
are the more distinguished of those who follow later.</p>

<h4><a id="c61b">a. <span class="smcap">Anselm.</span></a></h4>

<p>Amongst those who wished to give additional proof of
the doctrines of the Church through thought, is Anselm, a
man of great distinction and high repute. He was born at
Aosta, in Piedmont, about 1034; in 1060 he became a monk
at Bec, and in 1093 was raised to the rank of Archbishop of
Canterbury; in 1109 he died.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He sought to consider and
prove philosophically the doctrines of the Church, and it has
even been said of him that he laid the basis for scholastic
philosophy.</p>

<p>He speaks as follows of the relation of faith to thought:
“Our faith must be defended by reason against the godless,
and not against those who glory in the name of Christian;
for of these we may rightly demand that they should
hold firm to the obligations which they came under in
baptism. Those others must be shown through reason how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
irrationally they strive against us. The Christian must go
on through faith to reason, and not come from reason to
faith; but if he cannot attain to comprehension, he must
still less depart from faith. For if he is able to press on to
knowledge, he rejoices therein; when he is unable so to do,
he humbly adores.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He makes a noteworthy remark, which
contains his whole philosophy, in his work <i>Cur Deus homo</i>
(I. 2), which is rich in speculative thought: “It appears
to me great negligence if we are firm in the faith, and do
not seek also to comprehend what we believe.” Now this
is declared to be arrogance; immediate knowledge, faith, is
held to be higher than knowledge. But Anselm and the
scholastics maintained the opposite view.</p>

<p>Anselm may be regarded from this point of view as quite
specially the founder of scholastic theology. For the
thought of proving through a simple chain of reasoning
what was believed—that God exists—left him no rest day
and night, and tortured him for long. At first he believed
his desire to prove the divine truths through reason to be
a temptation of the devil, and he was in great anxiety and
distress on that account; finally, however, success came to
him by the grace of God in his <i>Proslogium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This is the
so-called ontological proof of the existence of God which he
set forth, and which made him specially famous. This
proof was included among the various proofs up to the time
of Kant, and—by some who have not yet reached the Kantian
standpoint—it is so included even to the present day. It is
different from what we find and read of amongst the
ancients. For it was said that God is absolute thought as
objective; for because things in the world are contingent,
they are not the truth in and for itself—but this is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in the infinite. The scholastics also knew well from the
Aristotelian philosophy the metaphysical proposition that
potentiality is nothing by itself, but is clearly one with
actuality. Later, on the other hand, the opposition between
thought itself and Being began to appear with Anselm.
It is noteworthy that only now for the first time through
the Middle Ages and in Christianity, the universal Notion
and Being, as it is to ordinary conception, became established
in this pure abstraction as these infinite extremes;
and thus the highest law has come to consciousness. But
we reach our profoundest depths in bringing the highest
opposition into consciousness. Only no advance was made
beyond the division as such, although Anselm also tried
to find the connection between the sides. But while
hitherto God appeared as the absolute existent, and the
universal was attributed to Him as predicate, an opposite
order begins with Anselm—Being becomes predicate, and
the absolute Idea is first of all established as the subject,
but the subject of thought. Thus if the existence of God
is once abandoned as the first hypothesis, and established
as a result of thought, self-consciousness is on the way to
turn back within itself. Then we have the question coming
in, Does God exist? while on the other side the question of
most importance was, What is God?</p>

<p>The ontological proof, which is the first properly metaphysical
proof of the existence of God, consequently came
to mean that God as the Idea of existence which unites all
reality in itself, also has the reality of existence within
Himself; this proof thus follows from the Notion of God,
that He is the universal essence of all essence. The drift
of this reasoning is, according to Anselm (Proslogium,
c. 2), as follows: “It is one thing to say that a thing is in
the understanding, and quite another to perceive that it
exists. Even an ignorant person (<i>insipiens</i>) will thus be
quite convinced that in thought there is something beyond
which nothing greater can be thought; for when he hears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this he understands it, and everything that is understood is
in the understanding. But that beyond which nothing
greater can be thought cannot certainly be in the understanding
alone. For if it is accepted as in thought alone,
we may go on farther to accept it as existent; that, however,
is something greater” than what is merely thought.
“Thus were that beyond which nothing greater can be
thought merely in the understanding, that beyond which
nothing greater can be thought would be something
beyond which something greater can be thought. But
that is truly impossible; there thus without doubt exists
both in the understanding and in reality something beyond
which nothing greater can be thought.” The highest
conception cannot be in the understanding alone; it is
essential that it should exist. Thus it is made clear that
Being is in a superficial way subsumed under the universal
of reality, that to this extent Being does not enter into
opposition with the Notion. That is quite right; only the
transition is not demonstrated—that the subjective understanding
abrogates itself. This, however, is just the
question which gives the whole interest to the matter.
When reality or completion is expressed in such a way that
it is not yet posited as existent, it is something thought, and
rather opposed to Being than that this is subsumed under it.</p>

<p>This mode of arguing held good until the time of Kant;
and we see in it the endeavour to apprehend the doctrine
of the Church through reason. This opposition between
Being and thought is the starting point in philosophy,
the absolute that contains the two opposites within itself—a
conception, according to Spinoza, which involves its
existence likewise. Of Anselm it is however to be remarked
that the formal logical mode of the understanding,
the process of scholastic reasoning is to be found in him,
the content indeed is right, but the form faulty. For in
the first place the expression “the thought of a Highest”
is assumed as the <i>prius</i>. Secondly, there are two sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
objects of thought—one that is and another that is not;
the object that is only thought and does not exist, is as
imperfect as that which only is without being thought.
The third point is that what is highest must likewise exist.
But what is highest, the standard to which all else must
conform, must be no mere hypothesis, as we find it represented
in the conception of a highest acme of perfection, as
a content which is thought and likewise <i>is</i>. This very
content, the unity of Being and thought, is thus indeed the
true content; but because Anselm has it before him only
in the form of the understanding, the opposites are identical
and conformable to unity in a third determination only—the
Highest—which, in as far as it is regulative, is outside
of them. In this it is involved that we should first of all
have subjective thought, and then distinguished from that,
Being. We allow that if we think a content (and it is
apparently indifferent whether this is God or any other),
it may be the case that this content does not exist. The assertion
“Something that is thought does not exist” is now
subsumed under the above standard and is not conformable
to it. We grant that the truth is that which is not merely
thought but which likewise is. But of this opposition
nothing here is said. Undoubtedly God would be imperfect,
if He were merely thought and did not also have
the determination of Being. But in relation to God we
must not take thought as merely subjective; thought here
signifies the absolute, pure thought, and thus we must
ascribe to Him the quality of Being. On the other hand if
God were merely Being, if He were not conscious of Himself
as self-consciousness, He would not be Spirit, a thought
that thinks itself.</p>

<p>Kant, on the other hand, attacked and rejected Anselm’s
proof—which rejection the whole world afterwards followed
up—on the ground of its being an assumption that the
unity of Being and thought is the highest perfection.
What Kant thus demonstrates in the present day—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Being is different from thought and that Being is not by
any means posited with thought—was a criticism offered
even in that time by a monk named Gaunilo. He combated
this proof of Anselm’s in a <i>Liber pro insipiente</i> to which
Anselm himself directed a reply in his <i>Liber apologeticus
adversus insipientem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Thus Kant says (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, p. 464 of the sixth edition): If we think a
hundred dollars, this conception does not involve existence.
That is certainly true: what is only a conception does not
exist, but it is likewise not a true content, for what does not
exist, is merely an untrue conception. Of such we do not
however here speak, but of pure thought; it is nothing new
to say they are different—Anselm knew this just as well as
we do. God is the infinite, just as body and soul, Being and
thought are eternally united; this is the speculative, true
definition of God. To the proof which Kant criticizes in a
manner which it is the fashion to follow now-a-days,
there is thus lacking only the perception of the unity of
thought and of existence in the infinite; and this alone
must form the commencement.</p>

<p>Other proofs such, for example, as the cosmological,
which argues from the contingency of the world to an
absolute existence, have thereby not reached the idea of
absolute essence as spirit, and are without consciousness
of the fact that it is an object of thought. The old
physico-theological proof, which even Socrates possessed,
from beauty, order, organic ends, indeed implies an understanding,
a richer thought of absolute existence, and not
alone an indeterminate Being, but in this proof it likewise
remains unknown that God is the Idea. And then what
sort of an understanding is God? A different and immediate
one; then this spirit is independent. Further,
disorder likewise exists, and thus there must be something
else conceived of than this apparent order of nature only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
But from asking about the existence of God, from making
his objective mode a predicate and thus knowing that God
is Idea, to pass to making the absolute existence I&nbsp;=&nbsp;I,
thinking self-consciousness, not as predicate but in such
a way that each thinking I is the moment of this self-consciousness—is
still a long stride. Here, where we see
this form first emerge, absolute existence is clearly to be
taken as the Beyond of finite consciousness; this is to
itself the null and void, and it has not yet grasped its
sense of self. Its thoughts regarding things are manifold,
and the mere fact of being a thing is to it likewise just
such a predicate as the rest; but it is thereby not yet
turned back within itself, it knows of existence, but not of
itself.</p>

<p>In this, says Tennemann (Vol. VIII. Sec. I. p. 121),
“Anselm has laid the first formal ground of scholastic
theology;” but even before this the same was present, only
to a more limited extent, and merely for individual dogmas—as
is also the case with Anselm. His writings bear
witness of great penetration and mental ability; and he
gave rise to the philosophy of the scholastics, inasmuch as
he united theology to philosophy. The theology of the
Middle Ages thus stands much higher than that of modern
times; never have Catholics been such barbarians as to
say that there should not be knowledge of the eternal
truth, and that it should not be philosophically comprehended.
This is one point which has to be specially noted
in Anselm, the other is that he apprehended in its unity
that highest opposition between thought and Being spoken
of above.</p>

<h4><a id="c67">b. <span class="smcap">Abelard.</span></a></h4>

<p>With Anselm Peter Abelard is associated, both being
mainly concerned in the introduction of philosophy into
theology. Abelard lived about 1100—from 1079 to
1142—and is famed for his learning, but still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
famed in the world of sentiment and passion for his
love to Heloise and his after fate.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> After the days of
Anselm he attained to great repute, and he followed him
in his treatment of the doctrines of the Church, more especially
seeking to give a philosophic proof of the Trinity. He
taught at Paris. Paris about this time was to the theologians
what Bologna was to the jurists, the central point
of the sciences; it was at that time the seat of philosophizing
theology. Abelard often delivered his lectures there before
a thousand listeners. Theological science and philosophizing
regarding it, was in France (as was jurisprudence in Italy)
a matter of great importance, which, as most significant in
the development of France, has hitherto been too much
neglected. The conception prevailed that philosophy and
religion were one and the same; which they absolutely
speaking are. But the distinction was soon reached, “that
much may be true in philosophy and false in theology:”
this the Church denied. Tennemann (Vol. VIII. Sec. II.
pp. 460, 461) quotes as follows from a rescript of the Bishop
Stephen: “They say that this is true according to philosophy,
and not according to the Catholic faith, just as if
there were two contradictory truths, and as if in the
doctrines of the accursed heathen a truth contradictory to
the truth of the holy scriptures could be present.” While
then undoubtedly, through the separation of the four
faculties in the University of Paris which came about in
1270, philosophy became separated from theology, it was yet
forbidden to it to subject theological beliefs and dogmas
to disputation.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c68">2. <span class="smcap">Methodical Representation of the Doctrinal
System of the Church.</span></a></h3>

<p>We now go on to the more definite form which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
scholastic theology reached; for in a second development
of scholastic philosophy the main endeavour became
to make the teaching of the Christian Church methodical,
while still keeping its connection with all previous metaphysical
arguments. These and their counter-arguments
were placed side by side in stating every dogma, so that
theology became represented in a scientific system, while
before this the ecclesiastical teaching in the general
education of the clergy was limited to the propounding of
successive dogmas, and the writing down of passages from
Augustine and other Fathers bearing on each proposition.</p>

<h4><a id="c69">a. <span class="smcap">Peter Lombard.</span></a></h4>

<p>Peter of Novara in Lombardy was the first of those who
brought this to pass; he dates from the middle of the
twelfth century, and was the originator of this method.
He died in the year 1164. Petrus Lombardus set forth a
whole system of scholastic theology which remained for
several centuries the basis of the doctrine of the Church.
He composed to that end his <i>Quatuor libros sententiarum</i>,
and hence he likewise received the name <i>Magister sententiarum</i>.
For in those times every learned schoolman had
some predicate such as <i>Doctor acutus</i>, <i>invincibilis</i>, <i>sententiosus</i>,
<i>angelicus</i>, &amp;c. Others also availed themselves of
the same title for their works; thus Robert Pulleyn wrote
<i>Sententiarum libros octo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Lombard collected the principal points in church doctrines
from councils and Fathers, and then added subtle questions
respecting particular items; with these the schools
occupied themselves, and they became a subject of disputation.
He himself, indeed, answered these questions,
but he caused counter-arguments to follow, and his answer
often left the whole matter problematical, so that the
questions were not properly decided. The arguments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
thus enumerated on either side; even the Fathers contradicted
themselves, and numerous passages from them were
quoted by both the opposed sides in support of their
respective views. In this way <i>theses</i> arose, then <i>quæstiones</i>,
in reply to these <i>argumenta</i>, then again <i>positiones</i>, and
finally <i>dubia</i>; according as men chose to take the words
in this sense or that, and followed this or that authority.
Yet a certain degree of method began to enter in.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, this middle of the twelfth century
forms the epoch in which scholasticism became more
universal as a learned theology. The book of Lombard
was all through the Middle Ages commentated by the
<i>doctores theologicæ dogmaticæ</i>, who were now held to be
the recognized guardians of ecclesiastical doctrine, while
the clergy had charge of the soul. Those doctors had great
authority, they held synods, criticized and condemned this
or that doctrine and book as heretical, &amp;c., in synods or as
the Sorbonne, a society of such doctors in the University
of Paris. They took the place of assemblages of the
Church, and were something like the Fathers in reference
to the Christian doctrine. In particular they rejected the
writings of the mystics like Amalrich and his disciple
David of Dinant, who, resembling Proclus in their point of
view, went back to unity. Amalrich, who was attacked as a
heretic in 1204, for instance said, “God is all, God and the
Creature are not different, in God all things are, God is
the one universal substance.” David asserted, “God is the
first matter and everything is one in matter, and God is
just this unity.” He divided everything into three classes,
bodies, souls, eternal immaterial substances or spirits.
“The indivisible principle of souls is the νοῦς, and that of
spirits is God. These three principles are identical and hence
all things in essence are one.” His books were burned.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h4><a id="c71">b. <span class="smcap">Thomas Aquinas.</span></a></h4>

<p>The other individual who was equally famous with Peter
Lombard, was Thomas Aquinas, born in 1224 of the noble
race Aquino, in his paternal castle Roccasicca, in the province
of Naples. He entered the Order of Dominicans, and
died in 1274 on a journey to a church council at Lyons.
He possessed a very extensive knowledge of theology, and
also of Aristotle; he was likewise called <i>Doctor angelicus</i>
and <i>communis</i>, a second Augustine. Thomas Aquinas was
a disciple of Albertus Magnus, he wrote commentaries on
Aristotle and on Petrus Lombardus; and he also himself
composed a <i>summa theologiæ</i> (that is, a system) which with
his other writings obtained for him the greatest honour, and
which became one of the principal text-books in scholastic
theology.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In this book there are found, indeed, logical
formalities—not, however, dialectical subtleties, but fundamental
metaphysical thoughts regarding the whole range
of theology and philosophy.</p>

<p>Thomas Aquinas likewise added questions, answers and
doubts, and he gave the point on which the solution
depended. The main business of scholastic theology consisted
in working out the <i>summa</i> of Thomas. The principal
point was to make theology philosophic and more widely
systematic; Peter Lombard and Thomas Aquinas are best
known in respect of this endeavour, and for long their works
formed the basis of all further learned elaborations of
doctrine. With Thomas, Aristotelian forms constitute the
basis—that of substance (<i>forma substantialis</i>) is, for instance,
analogous to the entelechy (ἐνέργεια) of Aristotle. He
said of the doctrine of knowledge, that material things
consist of form and matter; the soul has the substantial
form of the stone in itself.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h4><a id="c72">c. <span class="smcap">John Duns Scotus.</span></a></h4>

<p>In respect of the formal development of philosophic
theology a third individual is famous, namely, Duns Scotus,
<i>Doctor subtilis</i>, a Franciscan, who was born at Dunston in
the county of Northumberland, and who little by little
obtained thirty thousand disciples. In the year 1304 he
came to Paris, and in 1308 to Cologne, as a doctor in the
university newly instituted there. He was received with
great rejoicings, but he died there of apoplexy soon after
his arrival, and is said to have been buried alive. He is
supposed to have been only 34, according to others 43,
and according to others again 63 years old, for the year
of his birth is not known.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He wrote commentaries on
the <i>Magister sententiarum</i>, which procured for him the
fame of a very keen thinker, following the order of
beginning with the proof of the necessity of a supernatural
revelation as against the mere light of reason.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> On
account of his power of penetration he has been likewise called
the <i>Deus inter philosophos</i>. He was accorded the most
excessive praise. It was said of him: “He developed
philosophy to such an extent that he himself might have
been its discoverer if it had not already been discovered;
he <i>knew</i> the mysteries of the faith so well that he can
scarcely be said to have <i>believed</i> them; he knew the secrets
of providence as though he had penetrated them, and the
qualities of angels as though he were himself an angel; he
wrote so much in a few years that scarcely one man could
read it all, and hardly any were able to understand it.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>According to all testimony it appears that Scotus helped
the scholastic method of disputation to reach its height,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
finding the material for the same in arguments and counter-arguments
arranged in syllogisms; his manner was to add
to each <i>sententia</i> a long succession of <i>distinctiones</i>, <i>quæstiones</i>,
<i>problemata</i>, <i>solutiones</i>, <i>argumenta pro et contra</i>.
Because he also refuted his arguments in a similar series,
everything fell once more asunder; hence he was held to
be the originator of the quodlibetan method. The <i>Quodlibeta</i>
signified collections of miscellaneous dissertations on
individual objects in the every-day manner of disputation,
which speaks of everything, but without systematic order
and without any consistent whole being worked out and
set forth; others, on the other hand, wrote <i>summas</i>. The
Latin of Scotus is exceedingly barbarous, but well suited
for exact philosophic expression; he invented an endless
number of new propositions, terms and syntheses.</p>

<h3><a id="c73a">3. <span class="smcap">Acquaintanceship with Aristotelian Writings.</span></a></h3>

<p>We must further remark a third development, which
proceeded from the external historical circumstance that
in the end of the twelfth and in the thirteenth century the
Western theologians became more generally acquainted with
the Aristotelian writings and their Greek and Arabian
commentators, in Latin translations from the Arabic. These
now became much used by them, and were made the
subject of further commentaries and discussions. The
veneration, admiration and respect which Aristotle received,
now reached its height.</p>

<h4><a id="c73b">a. <span class="smcap">Alexander of Hales.</span></a></h4>

<p>The familiar acquaintance with Aristotle and the Arabians
became first evident in Alexander of Hales (died 1245), the
<i>Doctor irrefragabilis</i>. The earlier stages by which this
familiarity came about has been shown above (p. 35).
Hitherto the acquaintance with Aristotle was very slight,
and through many centuries it was limited, as we saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
above (p. 37), more especially to his Logic, which had
survived from the earliest times and was transmitted in the
works of Boethius, Augustine and Cassiodorus. It was
only when we came to Scotus Erigena that we found
(p. 59) a knowledge of Greek, although it was quite
unusual in his day. In Spain, under the Arabians, the
sciences flourished greatly. In particular the university of
Cordova in Andalusia was a centre-point of learning;
many from the lands of the West journeyed thither, just
as even the Pope Sylvester II., so well known in his
earlier days as Gerbert, escaped as a monk to Spain for
the purpose of studying with the Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The sciences of
medicine and alchemy were diligently pursued. Christian
doctors there studied medicine under the Jewish-Arabian
teachers. It was principally the Aristotelian metaphysics
and physics which were then known, and from these
abstracts (<i>summæ</i>) were constructed. The logic and
metaphysics of Aristotle were spun out with extreme
fineness into endless distinctions, and brought into genuine
syllogistic forms of the understanding, which constituted
for the most part the principle for the treatment of the
subject dealt with. In this way dialectic subtlety was
much increased, while the properly speculative side in
Aristotle remained for the spirit of externality, and consequently
also of irrationality, in the background.</p>

<p>The Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II. then sent for
Aristotelian books from Constantinople and had them
translated into Latin. At first, indeed, on the first appearance
of the Aristotelian writings, the Church made difficulties;
the reading of his metaphysics and physics and
the abstracts prepared therefrom, as also the exposition of
the same, was forbidden by a church synod held at Paris
1209. Likewise in 1215 the cardinal Robert Corceo came
to Paris and there held a visitation of the university, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
which occasion he ordained that regular lectures on the
dialectical writings of Aristotle should be held while he
forbade the reading of and lecturing on the metaphysics and
natural philosophy of Aristotle, and the abstracts prepared
from them; he also condemned the doctrines of the heretics
David of Dinant and Amalrich and likewise the Spaniard
Mauritius. Pope Gregory, in a bull issued to the University
of Paris in 1231, without mentioning metaphysics, forbade
the books of the Physics to be read until they had been
examined and purified from all suspicion of error. But
later on, in 1366, it was on the other hand ordained by
two cardinals that no one could be made a <i>magister</i> unless
he had studied the prescribed books of Aristotle—amongst
which were the Metaphysics and some of the Physics—and
had proved himself capable of explaining them.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It was
only much later on, however, when Greek literature in
general had again become widely diffused, that men became
better acquainted with the Greek text of the Aristotelian
writings.</p>

<h4><a id="c75">b. <span class="smcap">Albertus Magnus.</span></a></h4>

<p>Amongst those who distinguished themselves through
their commentaries on Aristotle’s writings, we must specially
mention Albertus Magnus, the most celebrated German
schoolman, of the noble race of Bollstadt. Magnus either
was his family name, or it was given him on account
of his fame. He was born in 1193 or 1205 at Lauingen
on the Danube in Swabia, and began by studying at
Padua, where his study is still shown to travellers. In the
year 1221 he became a Dominican friar, and afterwards
lived at Cologne as Provincial of his Order in Germany:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in 1280 he died. It is said of him that in his youth he
showed himself very dull and stupid, until, according to a
legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to him in company with
three other beautiful women, incited him to the study of
Philosophy, liberated him from his dulness of understanding,
and promised him that he should enlighten the Church,
and, in spite of his science, should still die in the faith.
What happened was in accordance with this prophecy, for
five years before his death he forgot all his philosophy as
quickly as he learned it, and then actually died in the
dulness and orthodoxy of his earlier years. Hence there
is current regarding him an old saying: “Albert
changed quickly from an ass into a philosopher, and from
a philosopher into an ass.” His learning was generally
understood to consist largely of magic. For although
natural objects have nothing to do with scholasticism
proper, which was really perfectly blind to nature, he
occupied himself much therewith; and amongst other
devices he manufactured a talking machine which alarmed
his pupil Thomas of Aquino, who even aimed a blow
at it, thinking he saw therein a work of the devil.
Likewise the fact that he received and entertained William
of Holland<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> in the middle of winter in a garden full of
blossom, is counted as magic.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> While as for us—we find
the winter-garden in Faust quite natural.</p>

<p>Albert wrote a great deal, and twenty-one folios remain
to us of his writings. He wrote on Dionysius the
Areopagite, commentated the <i>Magister sententiarum</i>, was
specially conversant with the Arabians and the Rabbis, as
he was also well acquainted with the works of Aristotle,
although he himself understood neither Greek nor Arabic.
He likewise wrote on the Physics of Aristotle. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
found in him a remarkable instance of deficient knowledge
of the history of Philosophy. He derived the name
Epicurean (Opera, T.V. pp. 530, 531) from the fact that
they idled away their time [auf der faulen Haut lagen] (ἐπὶ
<i>cutem</i>) or else from <i>cura</i> because they concerned themselves
with many useless things (<i>supercurantes</i>). He represents
the Stoics as being something like our choir-boys; he says
that they were people who made songs (<i>facientes cantilenas</i>),
and roamed about in porticoes. For, as he here remarks
in a very learned way, the first philosophers clothed their
philosophy in verses, and then sang them in halls and porches,
and hence they are called standers in the porch (<i>Stoici</i>).
Gassendi relates (<i>Vita Epicuri</i>, I. c. 11, p. 51) that Albertus
Magnus mentioned as the first Epicureans, Hesiodus, Athalius
or Achalius (of whom we know nothing), Cæcina, or,
as others call him, Tetinnus, a friend of Cicero, and Isaacus,
the Jewish philosopher. How that is arrived at we do not
know at all. Of the Stoics Albertus, on the contrary,
mentions Speusippus, Plato, Socrates and Pythagoras.
These anecdotes give us a picture of the condition of
culture in these times.</p>

<h3><a id="c77">4. <span class="smcap">Opposition Between Realism and Nominalism.</span></a></h3>

<p>In the fourth place we must mention an important
matter, to which much attention was devoted in the Middle
Ages, namely that particular philosophic question which
formed the subject of controversy between the Realists
and the Nominalists, and the discussion of which was
continued through very nearly the whole of the Scholastic
period. Speaking generally, this controversy is concerned
with the metaphysical opposition between the universal
and the individual; it occupies the attention of Scholastic
philosophy for several centuries, and reflects great credit
upon it. A distinction is drawn between the earlier and
later Nominalists and Realists, but otherwise their history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
is very obscure; and we know more of the theological
aspect of the subject than of this.</p>

<h4><a id="c78">a. <span class="smcap">Roscelinus.</span></a></h4>

<p>The beginning of the controversy dates back to the
eleventh century, Roscelinus being the earliest Nominalist.
The famous Abelard, although he professes to be an
opponent of Roscelinus, is himself nothing more or less
than a Nominalist. Roscelinus wrote also against the
doctrine of the Trinity, and was pronounced guilty of
heresy in 1092 at an ecclesiastical council which met at
Soissons. His influence was, however, but small.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The matter in question is the universal as such (<i>universale</i>),
or the genus, the essence of things, what in Plato
was called the Idea—for instance, Being, humanity, the
animal. The followers of Plato asserted that these universals
exist; their existence was individualized, and thus
‘tableness’ was said to be also a real existence (<i>supra</i>, Vol. II.
p. 29). We make representations of a thing to ourselves,
and say “it is blue;” this is a universal. The question
now is whether such universals are something real in and
for themselves, apart from the thinking subject, and independent
of the individual existing thing, so that they
exist in the individual things independently of the
individuality of the thing and of each other; or whether
the universal is only nominal, only in the subjective representation,
a thing of thought. Those who maintained that
the universals had a real existence apart from the thinking
subject and distinct from the individual thing, and that
the Idea alone constitutes the essence of things, were
termed Realists—a use of the term in quite an opposite
sense to that which passes current now. I mean that this
expression has for us the signification that things as they
are in their immediacy have an actual existence; and to
this idealism is opposed, that being a name which was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
later to the philosophy which ascribes reality to ideas
alone, and asserts that things as they appear in their
individuality have no truth. The realism of the Scholastics
in the same way maintained that the Universal has an
independent, absolute existence, for Ideas are not liable to
destruction, like natural things, therefore they are immutable
and the only true existence. In opposition to this,
the others, the Nominalists or Formalists, asserted that if
generals or universals are formed, these are only names,
matters of form, representations which we make to ourselves,
a subjective generalization, a product of the thinking
mind; the individual alone is the real.</p>

<p>This is then the matter in question; it is of great
interest, and is founded upon a much higher opposition
than any the ancients knew of. Roscelinus made universal
conceptions arise only from the necessities of language.
He maintained that ideas or universals, like Being, life,
reason, are in themselves nothing but mere abstract notions
or generic names, which, as such, have in and for themselves
no universal reality of their own: that which has
Being and life is found in the individual alone. Against
these assertions arguments are brought forward by which
one can see that the manner in which the Christian world
was taken as basis, often became in the highest degree
ridiculous. For instance, Abelard reproaches Roscelinus
for having asserted that no thing has parts, that only the
words which denote the things are divisible. Abelard
proved that according to Roscelinus, Christ did not eat a
real part of the broiled fish, but only a part—I do not
know which—of the word “broiled fish,” since according
to him there were no parts—which interpretation would
be preposterous and highly blasphemous.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Our way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
reasoning from “healthy human understanding,” is not
much better.</p>

<h4><a id="c80">b. <span class="smcap">Walter of Mortagne.</span></a></h4>

<p>Walter of Mortagne (d. 1174) aimed at the union of the
particular and the universal, saying that the universal must
be individual, that universals must be united with individuals
in accordance with their essence.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In later times
the two rival factions were known to fame as Thomists,
from the Dominican Thomas Aquinas, and Scotists, from
the Franciscan Johannes Duns Scotus. Nevertheless, the
original question as to whether universal notions have
reality, and, if so, to what extent they have it, underwent a
great variety of modifications and gradations, just as the
opposing parties received very various names. Nominalism,
in its crude form, declared universal notions to be mere
names, which have reality only in speech, and it ascribed
reality to individuals alone; Realism followed the exactly
opposite course of attributing reality only to universals,
while it considered that what distinguished individual
things was an accident only or a pure difference. Neither
of these two theories was correct in the manner of passing
from the universal to the particular. There were some,
however, among the Schoolmen who grasped the true conception
that individuation, the limitation of the universal,
and indeed of what is most universal, Being and entity, is
a negation. Others said that the limit is itself something
positive, but that it is not one with the universal by union
with it, for it rather stands in a metaphysical connection
with it, that is, in a connection such as that which binds
thought with thought. This implies that the individual is
only a clearer expression of what is already contained in
the general conception; so that these conceptions, in spite
of their being divided into parts and differentiated, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
remain simple; Being or entity, moreover, really is a
Notion.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Thomas, who was a Realist, declared the universal Idea
to be indeterminate, and placed individuation in determinate
matter (<i>materia signata</i>), <i>i.e.</i> matter in its dimensions
or determinations. According to him, the original
principle is the universal Idea; the form, as <i>actus purus</i>,
may, as with Aristotle, exist on its own account; the
identity of matter and form, the forms of matter, as such,
are further removed from the original principle,—while
thinking substances are mere forms.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But for Scotus the
universal is rather the individual One, the one he thinks may
appear also in the other; he maintained therefore the
principle of individuation, and the formal character of the
universal. In his view indeterminate matter becomes
individual through an inward positive addition; the
substantial forms of things are their real essence. Occam
thus represents the views of Scotus: “In the thing that
exists outside of the soul the same Nature exists <i>realiter</i>
with the difference limiting (<i>contrahente</i>) it to a determinate
individual, being only formally distinguished, and in itself
neither universal nor individual, but incompletely universal
in the thing, and completely universal in the understanding.”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Scotus racked his brains much over this
subject. To universals the Formalists allowed only an
ideal reality in the divine and human intellect beholding
them.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We thus see how closely connected with this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the thought which we first meet with in the Scholastics,
namely the seeking and giving of so-called proofs of God’s
existence (<i>supra</i>, pp. 62-67).</p>

<h4><a id="c82">c. <span class="smcap">William Occam.</span></a></h4>

<p>The opposition between Idealists and Realists appeared
at an early stage, it is true, but it was not until later, after
the time of Abelard, that it became the order of the day,
and was invested with general interest. This was brought
about chiefly by the Franciscan William Occam, of the
village of Occam in the county of Surrey in England, who
was surnamed <i>Doctor invincibilis</i>, and flourished in the
beginning of the fourteenth century: the year of his birth
is unknown. He is greatly celebrated for his skill in
handling the weapons of logic; he is keen in discrimination
and fertile in devising arguments and counter-arguments.
Occam was a leading champion of Nominalism, which up
to this time had found only here and there a defender, like
Roscelinus and Abelard; his numerous followers received
the name of Occamists and were Franciscans, while the
Dominicans retained the name of Thomists. The conflict
between Nominalists and Realists raged with a burning
vehemence, and was carried to the greatest extremes; a
pulpit is still shown which was separated by a wooden
partition from the platform of the opponent, in order that
the disputants might not come to blows. Henceforth
theology was taught under two forms (<i>theologia scholastica
secundum utramque partem</i>). Owing to the civil wars in
France, politics also began gradually to affect the relationship
between the orders, and this lent increased importance
to the conflict into which jealousy had plunged the rival
factions. In 1322, at a convention of his order, and also
on other occasions, Occam and his order defended to the
utmost of their power the claims of the different princes,
such as the King of France and the Emperor of Germany,
Louis of Bavaria, against the pretensions of the Pope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Among the words of William to the Emperor were these,
“Do thou defend me with the sword, and I will defend
thee with the pen.” Interdicts of the Paris University
and Papal bulls were issued against Occam. The Paris
University forbade his doctrines to be taught or his works
quoted. A special prohibition was issued in 1340: “No
teacher shall venture to assert plainly, or in so many words,
that some familiar maxim of the author on whom he is
lecturing is false, but shall either assent to it, or distinguish
the true and the false significance; otherwise the dangerous
result is to be apprehended that the truths of the Bible
might be in like manner rejected. No teacher shall assert
that a maxim cannot be thus explained or further defined.”
Occam was excommunicated in 1328, and died at Munich
in 1343.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Occam asks in one of his writings (<i>in libr. I. Sentent.
Dist. II. Quæst. 4</i>), “Whether what is immediately and
proximately denoted by the universal and by the generic
name is a real thing outside of the soul, something intrinsic
and essential in the things to which it is common and which
are called by its name, and yet in reality distinguished
from them.” This definition of the Realists is given more
in detail by Occam as follows: “As to this question, one
opinion is that each generic designation or universal is a
thing really existing outside of the soul in each and every
individual, and that the Being (<i>essentia</i>) of each individual
is really distinguished from each individual” (<i>i.e.</i> from its
individuality), “and from each universal. Thus man, the
universal, is a true thing outside of the soul, which exists in
reality in each human being, but is distinguished from each
human being, from Universal living nature, and from the
universal substance, and in this way from all species and
genera, those that are subordinate as well as those that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
not subordinate.” The universal, the common designation
of all the individuals, is therefore, according to this, not
identical with the Self, the ultimate point of subjectivity.
“As many universal predicables as there are of any individual
thing”—<i>e.g.</i> humanity, reason, Being, life, quality, &amp;c.—“so
many really different things there are in nature, each
of which is really distinct from the other and from that
individual, and all these things are in no wise multiplied in
themselves, however much the separate predicables are
multiplied, which are in every individual of the same kind.”
That is the most uncompromising way of stating the independence
and isolation of every universal quality in a thing.
Occam refutes this, saying: “Nothing which is one in
number can, without being changed or multiplied, be present
in several subjects or individuals. Science invariably
restricts itself to propositions regarding the known; it is,
therefore, a matter of no moment whether the terms of the
propositions are known things outside of the soul, or only
in the soul; and therefore it is not necessary for the sake
of science to assume universal things, really distinct from
individual things.”</p>

<p>Occam proceeds to state other opinions opposed to that
first given; he does not exactly give his own decision, yet
in this same passage (Quæst. 8) he, in the main, argues in
favour of the opinion “that the universal is not something real
that has explicit subjectivity (<i>esse subjectivum</i>) neither in the
soul nor in the thing. It is something conceived, which, however,
has objective reality (<i>esse objectivum</i>) in the soul, while
the external thing has this objective reality as an explicitly
existent subject (<i>in esse subjectivo</i>). This comes to pass in
the following manner. The understanding, which perceives
a thing outside the soul, forms the mental image of a similar
thing, so that, if it had productive power, it would, like
an artist, exhibit it in an absolutely existing subject, as
numerically an individual distinct from any preceding.
Should anyone be displeased by this manner of speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the mental image as being <i>formed</i>, it may be said that the
mental image and every universal conception is a quality
existing subjectively in the mind, which by its nature is the
sign of a thing outside of the soul, just as the spoken word
is a sign of the thing, arbitrarily instituted for marking out
that thing.” Tennemann says (Vol. VIII. Section II. p.
864): “One result of this theory was that the principle of
individuation, which had occupied to such an extent the
attention of the Scholastics, was cast aside as utterly unnecessary.”
Thus the main question with the Scholastics concerns
the definition of the universal, and this was in itself
highly important and significant for the culture of more
modern times. The universal is the One, but not abstract;
it is conceived or thought of as comprehending all things in
itself. With Aristotle the universal was, in a judgment, the
predicate of the subject in question; in a syllogism it was the
<i>terminus major</i>. With Plotinus, and especially with Proclus,
the One is still incommunicable, and is known only by its
subordinate forms. But because the Christian religion is a
revelation, God is no longer therein the unapproachable, incommunicable,
a hidden mystery: for the various stages of
the progression from Him are verily His manifestation, and
the Trinity is thus the revealed. In this way the triads and
the One are not distinguished, but these three Persons in the
Godhead are themselves God and One, <i>i.e.</i> One as it is for
another, as in itself relative. The Father, the God of
Israel, is this One; the moment of the Son and of the Spirit
is the Most High in spiritual and bodily presence, the
former in the Church, the latter in Nature. With the Neo-Platonists
the universal is, on the contrary, only the first
condition of things which then merely opens out and develops;
with Plato and Aristotle it is rather the Whole, the
All, the All in One.</p>

<h4><a id="c85">d. <span class="smcap">Buridan.</span></a></h4>

<p>Buridan, a Nominalist, inclines to the view of the Determinists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
that the will is determined by circumstances.
Against him is cited the case of the ass which, being placed
between two equal bundles of hay, perforce perished from
hunger.</p>

<p>Louis XI., in 1473, confiscated the books of the Nominalists
and interdicted the teaching of their doctrines, but
in the year 1481 this interdict was removed. In the theological
and philosophical faculty Aristotle is said to have
been interpreted and studied, as were also his commentators,
Averroës, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c86">5. <span class="smcap">Formal Dialectic.</span></a></h3>

<p>The study of dialectics was carried to a very great height,
but it was quite formal in character; this constitutes the
fifth point for consideration. With this is closely connected
the interminable finding out of <i>termini technici</i>. This
formal dialectic was very ingenious in devising objects,
problems and questions, destitute of all religious and
philosophic interest, on which to practise its method of
procedure. The last remark that we have, however, in this
connection to make regarding the Scholastics is this, that it
was not only into the ecclesiastical system that they introduced
all possible formal relations of the understanding,
but that also objects intelligible in themselves—the intellectual
conceptions and religious ideas—they represented
as immediately and sensuously real, as brought down into the
externality of altogether sensuous relations, and in these relations
subjected to systematic investigation. Originally, it is
true, the basis was spiritual, but the externality in which it
was at once comprehended, made of the spiritual something
perfectly unspiritual. It may therefore be said that, on
the one hand, the Scholastics showed great profundity in
their treatment of Church dogma; and, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that they secularized it by placing it in quite inappropriate
external relations; thus here we have the worst kind of
secularity. For the dogma of the Church explicitly contains,
in the historical form of the Christian religion, a
number of ordinary conceptions determined in an external
way, which are connected with the spiritual, it is true, but
trench upon sensuous relationships. If a network of such
relationships is then contrived, there arises a host of oppositions,
contrasts, contradictions, which have not the very
slightest interest for us. It is this aspect of the matter
that the Scholastics have taken up and handled with finite
dialectic; and it is on this account that the Scholastics in
later times were so much ridiculed. Of this I have some
examples to give.</p>

<h4><a id="c87">a. <span class="smcap">Julian, Archbishop of Toledo.</span></a></h4>

<p>Julian, Archbishop of Toledo, sought, with as great
earnestness as if the salvation of the human race depended
on it, to answer questions which contain an absurd assumption.
In doing so he no less gives himself up to petty
triflings than do the philologists when they institute investigations
regarding Greek accents, metres, and verse-divisions.
For instance, there arises a question of this kind
as to the dead. It is a dogma of the Church, that man will
rise again; now if to this it be added that he will be clothed
with the body, we thereby enter the sensuous sphere. The
following were inquiries which arose in connection with
this question: “What will be the age of the dead when
they rise? Will they rise as children, youths, grown men,
or aged? In what form will they rise? What will be the
constitution of their bodies? Will the fat be again fat,
and the lean again lean? Will the distinction of sex
continue in that future life? Will those who rise again
recover all that they lost here in the way of nails and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hair?”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Thus a special distinction was drawn between the
actual dogma, which was indisputable, and the various
aspects of the supersensuous world which are connected
with that dogma. These were regarded, though often only
for the time being, as detached from the doctrinal system
of the Church. For the system was not so definitely
formulated but that anything in it might have to be
proved from the Fathers, until a council or a special
synod decided the point. Disputes were also possible
regarding the proofs which were given of the content of
this system; and besides there was quite a large amount of
matter which was open to discussion, and respecting which
the Scholastics—with the exception, of course, of the noble
men, renowned as <i>Doctores</i> and writers,—expressed themselves
in finite syllogisms and forms, which degenerated into
an utterly empty and formal craze for disputation. The
Scholastic Philosophy is thus the direct opposite of the
empirical science of the understanding, with which curiosity
is largely mingled, and which, careless of the Notion,
follows after facts alone.</p>

<h4><a id="c88">b. <span class="smcap">Paschasius Radbertus.</span></a></h4>

<p>About 840 another subject of discussion was raised,
namely, the birth of Christ, whether it was natural or
supernatural. This led to a protracted controversy. Paschasius
Radbertus wrote two volumes, <i>De partu beatæ
virginis</i>; and many others wrote and argued on the same
topic.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> They went so far as even to speak of an accoucheur,
and to discuss this subject; and many questions were
raised, to which our sense of what is fitting forbids us even
to turn our thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>God’s wisdom, omnipotence, foresight, and predetermination
led in the same way to a host of contradictions in
abstract, meaningless, local and trivial particulars, which
concern not God. In the works of Petrus Lombardus,
where the Trinity, the Creation, and the Fall are dealt with,
as also angels and their orders and ranks, questions are
found such as whether God’s providence and predetermination
would have been possible, had nothing been created; and
where God was before the Creation. Thomas of Strasburg
answered: <i>Tunc ubi nunc, in se, quoniam sibi sufficit ipse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Lombardus goes on to ask “If God can know more than
He knows?” as if potentiality and actuality still remained
distinguished; “If God retains at all times all power that
He has once possessed? Where the angels were after their
creation? If the angels have always existed?” A multitude
of other questions of this kind are raised regarding
the angels. Then he asks: “At what age was Adam
created? Why was Eve made from the rib, and not from
some other part of the man? Why during sleep, and not
when the man was awake? Why did the first human pair
not have intercourse in Paradise? How the human race
would have been propagated, if man had not sinned? If
in Paradise children would have been born with limbs fully
grown, and the complete use of their senses? Why it was
the Son, and not the Father or the Holy Ghost, who
became man?” To do this rests in the very Notion of the
Son. “If God could not have also become incarnate in
female form?”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Additional examples of <i>quæstiones</i> of this kind are given
by those who ridiculed such dialectic, for instance by
Erasmus in his <i>Encomium moriæ</i>: “Could there be several
sonships (<i>filiationes</i>) in Christ? Is the proposition possible
that God the Father hates the Son? Might God not have
also taken the form of a woman, or have passed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
devil? Might He not also have appeared in the form of an
ass or of a pumpkin? In what manner would the pumpkin
have preached and wrought miracles, and how would it
have been crucified?”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Thus were intellectual determinations
combined and distinguished in a manner altogether
without sense or thought. The main point is that the
Scholastics were like barbarians in their way of handling
divine things and bringing them into sensuous determinations
and relations. They thus introduced a completely
sensuous rigidity and these altogether external and senseless
forms into the purely spiritual, thus bringing it to a
lower and unspiritual level; Hans Sachs similarly made a
Nürnberg version of sacred history [die göttliche Geschichte
vernürnbergert]. In such representations as are given in
the Bible of the wrath of God, or of the history of God’s
work of creation, it is said that God did this or that,
naming some human and homely action. God is certainly
not to be looked on as something alien and unapproachable;
on the contrary, we are to come to Him with courage and
with all our heart. But to bring Him into the province
of thought, and strive in earnest after a knowledge of
Him, is a very different matter. The reverse of this is
to bring forward arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i>, for they decide
nothing, and are of no use; they are no more than the
assumptions which are only sensuous and finite determinations,
and therefore infinite differences and distinctions.
This barbarous use of the understanding is utterly
irrational; it is like putting a golden necklace on a sow.
The One is the Idea of the Christian religion, and it is
also the philosophy of the great and noble Aristotle;
neither of the two could have been more bedraggled and
besmirched, to so low a pass had the Christians brought
their spiritual Idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="c91a">6. <span class="smcap">Mystics.</span></a></h3>

<p>In the above sketch we have mentioned the principal
heads which come under our consideration in studying
Scholastic philosophy. With regard to this intrusion of
distinctions of the understanding and sensuous relations
into that which in and for itself and by virtue of its very
nature is spiritual, absolute and infinite, it is to be remarked
that to this craze for reducing everything to the finite,
some noble spirits here and there opposed themselves.
As such we must here, in the sixth place, make honourable
mention of the many great Scholastics who have been
named Mystics, for although they are to be distinguished
from the real ecclesiastical Scholastics, they followed upon
identical lines, and are closely connected with them. They
took but little interest in these discussions and arguments,
and maintained their purity in regard to Church
doctrines and philosophic speculation. Some of them were
pious and spiritual men, who carried on their philosophic
studies upon the lines of the Neo-Platonic philosophy, as
Scotus Erigena had done in earlier times. Among them
genuine philosophy is to be found—termed also Mysticism;
it tends to inwardness and bears a great resemblance to
Spinozism. They also derived morality and the religious
sentiment from actual feelings, and the meditations and
maxims we have from them embody these views.</p>

<h4><a id="c91b">a. <span class="smcap">John Charlier.</span></a></h4>

<p>John Charlier, more generally known as Von Jerson or
Gerson, was born in 1363; he wrote a <i>theologia mystica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<h4><a id="c91c">b. <span class="smcap">Raymundus of Sabunde.</span></a></h4>

<p>Very similar were the views expressed by Raymundus of
Sabunde or Sabeyde, a Spaniard of the fifteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and professor at Toulouse about the year 1437. In his
<i>theologia naturalis</i>, which he handled in a speculative spirit,
he dealt with the Nature of things, and with the revelation
of God in Nature and in the history of the God-man. He
sought to prove to unbelievers the Being, the trinity, the
incarnation, the life, and the revelation of God in Nature,
and in the history of the God-man, basing his arguments
on Reason. From the contemplation of Nature he rises to
God; and in the same way he reaches morality from
observation of man’s inner nature.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This purer and simpler
style must be set off against the other, if we are to do
justice to the Scholastic theologians in their turn.</p>

<h4><a id="c92a">c. <span class="smcap">Roger Bacon.</span></a></h4>

<p>Roger Bacon treated more especially of physics, but remained
without influence. He invented gunpowder, mirrors,
telescopes, and died in 1294.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<h4><a id="c92b">d. <span class="smcap">Raymundus Lullus.</span></a></h4>

<p>Raymundus Lullus, the <i>Doctor illuminatus</i>, made himself
famous chiefly by the art of thinking which he invented,
which was called the <i>ars magna</i>. He was born at Majorca
in 1234, and was one of those eccentric, unsettled natures
whose activity finds vent in all directions. He had a strong
inclination towards alchemy and great enthusiasm for the
sciences in general, as well as a fiery, restless power of
imagination. In his youth he led a reckless life, throwing
himself headlong into a round of pleasures; then he retreated
to a desert, and had there many visions of Jesus.
At this time the impulse shaped itself in his ardent nature
to dedicate his life to spreading the blessings of Christianity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
among the Mohammedans in Asia and Africa. In
order to carry on this work of conversion he learned
Arabic, travelled through Europe and Asia, sought for
assistance from the Pope and all the crowned heads of
Europe, without giving up, for all that, his interest in his
‘Art.’ He suffered persecution and passed through many
hardships and strange adventures, perils of death, imprisonments,
cruelties. He lived long in Paris at the beginning
of the fourteenth century, and was the author of well-nigh
four hundred works. After a life of the utmost restlessness,
he died in 1315, revered as a saint and martyr, his
death being the result of cruel treatment which he had
suffered in Africa.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The chief object aimed at in this man’s ‘Art’ was an
enumeration and arrangement of the various concepts under
which all objects fall, or of the pure categories according
to which they can be determined, so that it may be possible
in regard to every object to indicate with ease the conceptions
applicable to it. Lullus is so systematic that
he becomes at times mechanical. He constructed a diagram
in circles, on which were marked triangles through which
the circles pass. In these circles he arranged the various
concepts, and strove to give a complete catalogue of them.
Some of the circles were fixed, others movable, and they
were six in number, two of them indicating the subjects,
three the predicates, while the outermost circle represented
possible questions. For each class he had nine qualities,
to indicate which he chose nine letters, B C D E F G H I K.
Thus in the first place he wrote round the diagram nine
absolute predicates, goodness, greatness, duration, power,
wisdom, volition, virtue, truth, splendour; then he wrote
nine relative predicates, diversity, unanimity, opposition,
beginning, middle, end, the qualities of being greater,
equal, or less; in the third place he set down the questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Whether? What? Whence? Why? How great? Of what
nature? When? Where? How and wherewith? the ninth
of which contains two determinations; in the fourth place
he put nine substances (<i>esse</i>), viz. God (<i>divinum</i>), angel
(<i>angelicum</i>), heaven (<i>cæleste</i>), man (<i>humanum</i>), <i>imaginativum</i>,
<i>sensitivum</i>, <i>vegetativum</i>, <i>elementativum</i>, <i>instrumentativum</i>;
in the fifth place were nine accidents, <i>i.e.</i> natural
relations, viz. quantity, quality, relation, activity, passivity,
possession, position, time, place; and sixthly nine moral
relations, the virtues, viz. justice, prudence, courage, temperance,
faith, hope, love, patience, piety; and the vices, viz.
envy, wrath, inconstancy, covetousness, falsehood, gluttony,
riotousness, pride, sluggishness (<i>acedia</i>). These circles had
to be placed in a certain way, in order to give proper combinations.
By turning them round according to certain
rules, by which all substances received the absolute and
relative predicates which fitted them, it was supposed
that there would be obtained in every possible combination
universal science, truth, and the knowledge of
concrete objects in general.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<h2><a id="c94">C. <span class="smcap">General Standpoint of the Scholastics.</span></a></h2>

<p>After thus dealing with the subject in detail, we must
pronounce judgment on the Scholastics, and give an estimate
of them. Though the subjects which they investigated
were lofty, and though there were noble, earnest and
learned individuals in their ranks, yet this Scholasticism on
the whole is a barbarous philosophy of the finite understanding,
without real content, which awakens no true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
interest in us, and to which we cannot return. For although
religion is its subject matter, thought here reached such an
excessive point of subtlety that, as a form of the mere
empty understanding, it does nothing but wander amongst
baseless combinations of categories. Scholastic philosophy
is this utter confusion of the barren understanding in the
rugged North German nature. We see here two different
worlds, a kingdom of life and a kingdom of death. The
intellectual kingdom, which is outside and above, while in
the popular conception, is thereby brought within the
sphere of the mere understanding and the senses, even
though by nature it is purely peculative; and this does
not take place as in art, but, on the contrary, after the
fashion of ordinary reality. As the relationship of Father
and Son, to begin with, appealed to the senses, so the divine
world was furnished for the imaginative faculty and for
purposes of devotion (in a way unknown to the disciples
of Plato) with angels, saints and martyrs, instead of with
thoughts;—or the thoughts are nothing but a rubbishy
metaphysic of the understanding. In the supersensuous
world there was no reality of the thinking, universal,
rational self-consciousness to be met with: in the immediate
world of sensuous nature, on the other hand, there
was no divinity, because nature was but the grave of God,
in the same way that God was outside of nature. The
existence of the Church, as the government of Christ upon
earth, is higher, it is true, than the external existence which
stands in contrast to it; for religion must rule our temporal
affairs, and through the subjection of worldly power the
Church became a theocracy. But the divine kingdom, the
dwelling-place of the dead, was to be reached only through
the gate of death; yet the natural world was dead to an
equal degree—all that lived in it was the vision of that
other world, and hope—it had no present. It was of no
avail to introduce mediators as a connecting link, the
Virgin Mary, or the dead in a world beyond. The reconciliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
was formal, not absolute; for it was nothing but
the longing of man for a satisfaction to be found only in
another world. What purpose does all this serve? It
lies behind us as a thing of the past, and must continue
useless to us on its own merits. There is no good, however,
in calling the Middle Ages a barbarous period. It is
a singular kind of barbarism, and is not simple and rude;
for the absolute Idea and the highest culture have sunk
into barbarism, and that through the agency of thought.
Thus we have here, on the one hand, the most hideous form
of barbarism and perversion, but, on the other hand, the
never-failing source of a higher reconciliation.</p>

<p>If we seek an immediate contrast to scholastic philosophy
and theology and their methods, we may say that it is to
be found in the “healthy human understanding,” in outward
and inward experience, in the contemplation of
nature, and in humanity. The character of Greek humanity,
for instance, was that everything concrete, everything that
possessed interest for mind, had its place in the human
breast, and its root in the feelings and thoughts of man.
Intelligent consciousness, cultured science, has in such content
its real material—that in which it is and remains at
home with itself; knowledge busies itself on all sides with
that which concerns it, and remains true to itself, while
both on its serious and its playful side it finds in this
material, in Nature and its uniform laws, a standard and a
guide by which to direct its course aright. Even should
we go astray on ground like this, our errors keep in view
the fixed centre-point of the self-consciousness of the
human mind, and as errors even they have a root therein,
which as such forms the justification for them. It is only
a one-sided withdrawal from the unity of this root with the
altogether concrete ground-work and original, that is really
faulty. What we see here, in contrast with the above, is
the infinite truth, expressed as spirit, committed to a nation
of barbarians who have not the self-consciousness of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
spiritual humanity—they have a human breast, it is true,
but not yet a human spirit. The absolute truth does not
yet make itself real and present in actual consciousness,
but men are torn out of themselves. They still find this
content of spirit within themselves, introduced as into a
strange vessel full of the most intense impulses and desires
of physical and intellectual life, but it is like a ponderous
stone, whose enormous pressure they only feel, but which
they neither digest nor assimilate with their own impulses
or desires. Thus they can only find rest and reconciliation
when they come absolutely out of themselves, and
they have become fierce and savage in the very circumstances
and by the very means which ought to have rendered
their spirit peaceable and mild.</p>

<p>Just as truth was not yet the foundation of reality, so
science was likewise destitute of firm basis. The understanding,
when it comes to think, applies itself, it is true,
in the first place to the mysteries of religion, which, as an
altogether speculative content, exist for the rational Notion
only. But as Spirit, the rational element in question, has
not yet taken its place in thought, thought is still God-forsaken,
it is still only abstract, finite understanding, a
manner of thinking which is in itself quite formal and
devoid of content, which is a stranger to subjects of such
profundity as this, even when it is ostensibly occupying
itself with the same. This understanding therefore draws
its content entirely from things to which it remains altogether
alien, and which remain altogether alien to it; yet
it is not thereby at all circumscribed, for it observes no
bounds in its determinations and distinctions. It is just as
if one were to arbitrarily form and connect propositions,
words and tones—without making the presupposition that
they should by themselves express a concrete sense—which
need be only capable of being uttered, without having any
restriction except possibility, that is, that they must not
contradict each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, in so far as the understanding keeps
to the given religious content, it can prove this content;
one can demonstrate that it must be so, just as if it were a
geometrical proposition. But there still remains something
to be desired, in order that the satisfaction may be complete;
the content is proved, but I nevertheless do not
understand it. Thus Anselm’s excellent proposition (<i>supra</i>,
pp. 63, 64) in which we may perceive the general character of
the scholastic understanding, is a proof, it may be admitted,
of the existence of God, but it shows no comprehension of
it. Though I see the truth of the proposition, I have not
attained to the final point, the object of my desire; for
there is lacking the I, the inner bond, as inwardness of
thought. This lies only in the Notion, in the unity of the
particular and the universal, of Being and thought. For
the comprehension of this unity, without which there could
be no true proof, it was implied that further progress should
not take place after the manner of the understanding. It
was necessary that from the nature of thought itself it
should become evident how, taken on its own account, it
negates itself, and how the determination of Being itself
rests therein, or that the manner in which thought determines
itself into Being should be shown forth. On the other
hand it must in like manner be demonstrated in the case of
Being that it is its peculiar dialectic to abrogate itself, and
from itself to make itself a universal Notion. The determination
of itself into Being is certainly an object of
thought, whose content is thought itself. This is inwardness,
not a mere conclusion drawn from presuppositions.
Here in scholastic philosophy, however, the object is not
the nature of thought and Being, for what they are is a
mere matter of assumption.</p>

<p>The understanding may take its start from experience, a
given concrete content, a determinate contemplation of
nature, the human heart, right, duty, which are just exactly
what inwardness means. It may find its determinations, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to speak, on behalf of this content, and starting from this
point it may come to abstractions, such as matter and force
in physics. In this case, although a general form such as
this does not satisfy the content, it has at any rate therein
a fixed point, by which it can regulate itself, and a boundary
line for speculation, which would otherwise have no limit
set to its roaming. Or when we have the concrete perception
of state and family, reasoning has in this content a
fixed point which gives it guidance—a conception, which is
the main thing; the deficiency in its form becomes concealed
and forgotten, and emphasis is not laid on it. But in
scholastic philosophy, in the third place, a basis was not
sought in such objects as direct the course of reflection;
with this understanding of the Scholastics it was rather
the case that they received in the categories the external
culture of the understanding as tradition, and enlarged
upon it. Because there was no standard set up for this
scholastic understanding, either by concrete intuition or by
the pure Notion, it remained unregulated in its externality.
In later times this spirit-forsaken understanding came
across the philosophy of Aristotle, in an external way; but
that philosophy is a two-edged sword, a highly determinate,
clear understanding, which is at the same time speculative
Notion; in it the abstract determinations of the understanding,
taken by themselves, and powerless thus to stand,
pass away by means of dialectic, and have truth only when
taken in their connexion. The speculation that we find in
Aristotle has this condition, that such thought never
abandons itself to free reflection, but keeps ever before it
the concrete nature of the object; this nature is the Notion
of the thing, and this speculative essence of the thing is
the ruling spirit, which does not leave the determinations
of reflection free on their own account. But the Scholastics
laid down hard and fast the abstract determinations of the
understanding, which are always inadequate to their
absolute subject, and in like manner they took every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
example from life as subject, and since the concrete contradicts
them, they could hold fast by these determinations
of the understanding only by defining and limiting. In so
doing, however, they involved themselves in an endless web
of distinctions, which could themselves be held in the concrete,
and maintained thereby alone. There is thus no
“healthy human understanding” in such procedure of the
Scholastics; the former cannot oppose itself to speculation,
but it can very well take up a position hostile to ungrounded
reflection, seeing that it contains a basis and a rule of
guidance for abstract determinations of the understanding.
The Aristotelian philosophy is quite opposed to this Scholastic
procedure, but it became therein alienated from itself.
The fixed conception of the supersensuous world with its
angels and so on was a subject which the Scholastics
elaborated without any regulating standard, in barbaric
fashion, and they enriched and embellished it with the
finite understanding and with the finite relationships of the
same. There is present no immanent principle in the
thinking itself, but the understanding of the Scholastics
got into its possession a ready-made metaphysic, without
the need of making it relate to the concrete; this metaphysic
was killed, and its parts in their lifelessness were
separated and parcelled out. It might be said of the
Scholastics that they philosophized without conception,
that is, without a concrete; for <i>esse reale, esse formale, esse
objectivum, quidditas</i> (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι) they made their subjects
of discussion.</p>

<p>This crude understanding, in the fourth place, made
everything equal, reduced it all to the same level, and that
in virtue of its abstract universality, which was held to be
valid. In politics also the understanding aims at making
all alike equal. This crude understanding did not make
away with itself and its finitude, but in its dealings with
them simply reduced to finite relations Heaven, the Idea,
the intellectual, mystic, speculative world; for it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
no difference (and can make none) whether its finite
determinations are valid here or not. Hence arose these
senseless questions, and the endeavours to decide them;
for it is senseless, I may even say it is distasteful and
revolting, although it may be logically correct, to carry
over determinations into a field where they are utterly out
of place, as soon as it comes to be a matter of comprehending
a concrete content in its universality. This
understanding in its operations furnishes no bridge from
the universal to the particular, and the conclusions which
it draws it leaves up in the clouds as conceptions of its
fancy. If, for instance, law is divided into canonical law,
criminal law, and so on, the ground of division is not taken
from the universal itself; and it is thus left vague which
particular determination is in accordance with the universal
object. If this object is God,—for instance, such a determination
as that He became man—the relation between
God and man is not derived from their nature. Because
God only manifests Himself, He can do so in any way
whatever; then, because nothing is impossible with God,
the pumpkin idea is easily introduced (p. 90), since it
is a matter of indifference in which determination the
Universal is supposed to be. Regarding the apple in
Paradise the understanding asks to what species of apple
it belonged.</p>

<p>We must go on to indicate the principles which have
been adopted and stand opposed to one other, and the
development of the same, in order to comprehend the
transition into modern history and the present standpoint
of philosophy. For this reason we must speak of the
further progress of universal spirit. For thought was
distorted by reason of its being bound to an externality,
and spirit was in it no longer acting for spirit. Because
then in this and similar ways the Idea of spirit had, as it
were, its heart pierced through, the parts remained without
spirit and life, and were worked upon by the understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Amongst the learned ignorance of the rational
was displayed, a complete and unnatural lack of spirituality;
and in the same way there was the most utter and terrible
ignorance amongst the others, the monks. This destruction
of knowledge brought about the transition to a
different state of affairs; while heaven and the divine
were thus degraded, the lofty aspirations and high
spiritual claims of the clerical element rose above the
secular. For we saw that the supersensuous world
of truth, as the world of religious conceptions, was
ruined by the understanding making all things equal.
We saw, on the one hand, a handling of dogma in
philosophic fashion, but we saw also a development of
formal logical thought, the secularization of the absolutely
existent content. In the same way the existing
Church, this presence of heaven upon earth, brought itself
down to the level of the secular, by entering upon the
possession of riches and lands. In this way the distinction
between the world and the Church is blotted out, not in a
rational manner as regards the Church, but in a way that
is altogether revolting, and which amounts to destruction:
it is a reality, I grant, but one most terrible and barbarous.
For state, government, right, property, civil order, all
these enter into religion as rational differences, that is,
laws on their own account fixed. The acknowledgment of
ranks, classes, divisions, their different occupations, the
stages and degrees of evil, as well as of good, are an entering
into the form of finitude, actuality, existence of the subjective
will, while what is religious has only the form of
infinity. But the Church in its outward existence is inviolable,
it can throw over all the laws of the good; every
offence against it is a violation of sanctity. Evil and its
penalties are made eternal, divergences of opinion are
punished even with death: so are heresy and also heterodoxy
in respect of the most abstract and empty determinations
of an endless system of dogmas. Abominable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
practices and evil passions, utter wantonness, voluptuousness,
bribery, dissoluteness, avarice, crimes of all kinds
found their way into the Church, because it was unrestrained
by laws; and it founded and maintained the system of
government. The secular ought to be only secular; but
this whole secular government of the Church claims at the
same time the dignity and authority of the divine. This
mingling of the sacred, divine, inviolable, with temporal
interests, begets, on the one hand, fanaticism, as among
the Turks, and on the other hand, the humility and
<i>obedientia passiva</i> of the laity against this dread power.
It was this ruin of the supersensuous world, as represented
in knowledge and as the actual Church, that inevitably
forced man out of a temple such as this, the Holy of Holies
degraded into finitude.</p>

<p>Against this disunion, on the other hand, the secular
element has spiritualized itself in itself; or it has established
itself firmly in itself, and that in a manner which
the Spirit justifies. To religion was lacking the presence
of its culminating point, the present reality of its head; to
the present secularity there is lacking the presence in it of
thought, reason, spirit. In the tenth century there was
manifested in Christendom a general impulse to build
churches, although it was not possible to regard God Himself
as present therein. It was thus that Christianity rose
up, in her longing to take to herself the principle of reality
as absolutely her own. But neither these buildings, nor
external wealth, nor the power and dominion of the
Church, nor monks, nor clergy, nor Pope, are the principle
of real actual presence in her; they were insufficient for
the spiritual. The Pope or the Emperor is not Dalai-lama,
the Pope is only the Vicar of Christ; Christ, as a
past existence, is in memory and hope alone. Impatient
at the lack of reality and at the want of holiness, Christendom
goes to seek this true Head; and this is the ruling
motive of the Crusades. Christendom sought Christ’s outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
presence in the land of Canaan, the traces of Him,
the mount where He suffered, His grave; they took possession
of the Holy Sepulchre. What they represent to
themselves as real they also take possession of in fact as
real; but a grave is a grave—all that they find is a grave,
and even that is torn from them. “Because Thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy
One to see corruption.” Christians made the mistake
of thinking that they would find satisfaction in this; this
was the true object of their search; but they did not
understand themselves. These holy spots, the Mount of
Olives, the Jordan, Nazareth, as external sensuous presence
of place without presence of time, are things of the past, a
mere memory, no perception of the immediate present;
the Christians found only their loss, their grave, in this
present. Barbarians all the time, they did not seek the
universal, the world-controlling position of Syria and Egypt,
this central point of the earth, the free connection of
commerce; Bonaparte did this when mankind became
rational. The Crusaders were by the Saracens and by
their own violence and repulsiveness, as also by their
own misery (p. 53), brought to confess that they had in
this deceived themselves. This experience taught them
that they must hold to the actual reality which they despised,
and seek in this the realization of their intelligible
world. What they sought for they were to find in themselves,
in the present of the understanding; thought, personal
knowledge and will constitute this present. Because
their acts, their aims and their interests are upright, and
thus are constituted the Universal, the present is rational.
What pertains to the world has thus become fixed in itself,
that is, it has received into itself thought, justice, reason.</p>

<p>With reference to the general aspect of the period, from
an historical point of view, it may be remarked that as on
the one side we see the selflessness of spirit, the fact that
spirit is not at home with itself, the torn and rent condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of man, on the other side we see the political condition
becoming more consolidated, in the establishment of an
independence which is no longer merely selfish. In the
first independence there is contained the moment of barbarism,
which has need of fear in order to be held within
bounds. Now, however, we see justice and order enter in;
it is true that the ruling order is the feudal system with
its servitude, but everything therein has certainly a firm
basis in justice. Justice, however, has its root in freedom,
and thus the individual therein brings himself into existence,
and is recognized; nevertheless relationships which properly
belong to the state are here still made the concern of
private individuals. Feudal monarchy, which now emerges
in opposition to the self-abnegation of the Church, determines
essential rights, it is true, according to birth; ranks are
not, however, like the system of caste among the Indians, for
in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, for instance, anyone might
from the lowest class rise to the very highest position.
Even under the feudal system, moreover, justice, civil
order, legal freedom gradually emerged. In Italy and
Germany cities obtained their rights as citizen republics,
and caused these to be recognized by the temporal and
ecclesiastical power; wealth displayed itself in the Netherlands,
Florence and the free cities on the Rhine. In this
way men gradually began to emerge from the feudal
system; an example of this is seen in the case of the
Capitani. The fact that the <i>lingua volgare</i> became the
language used may also be looked on as a springing up of
self-abnegation of spirit: as in Dante’s <i>Divina Commedia</i>.</p>

<p>The spirit of the times took this new direction; it forsook
the intellectual world, and looked upon its present world,
this hither side. The finite heaven, the content which had
lost its religious character, drove it to the finite present.
With this revolution the scholastic philosophy sinks and is
lost, as its thoughts are outside of reality. While the
Church heretofore believed itself to be in possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
divine truth, so now the temporal government, as it received
into itself order and right, and worked its way out
through the hard discipline of service, felt itself to be a
divine institution, and consequently considered that it had
the divine element here present in it, and that it was
justified in having an independent existence in opposition
to the divine element in the Church, which takes up an
exclusive position as regards the laity. Since in this way
the temporal power, the worldly life, self-consciousness,
has taken into itself the higher and more divine ecclesiastical
principle, the harsh contrast has disappeared. The
power of the Church appeared as the violence of the
Church, not aiming at operating in accordance with reality
and in reality, but at being mighty in the spirit. There at
once came into the secular element the consciousness that
abstract Notions were filled with the reality of the present,
so that this was no longer a nullity, but had truth also in
itself.</p>

<p>With this commerce and the arts are associated. It is
implied in the arts that man brings what is divine out of
himself; as artists were at one time so pious that as
individuals they had self-abnegation as their principle, it
was they from whose subjective abilities these representations
were produced. With this is connected the circumstance
that the secular knew that it had in itself the right
to hold to such determinations as are founded on subjective
freedom. In his handicraft the individual is taken in
reference to his work, and is himself the producer. Thus
men came to the point of knowing that they were free,
and insisting on the recognition of that freedom, and having
the power of exercising their activity for their own objects
and interests. Thus spirit came again to itself; it drew
itself together again, and looked into its reason, as if
looking into its own hands. This new birth is pointed
out as the revival of the arts and sciences which were
concerned with present matter, the epoch when the spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
gains confidence in itself and in its existence, and finds its
interest in its present. It is in reality reconciled with the
world, not implicitly, far away in mere thought, at the last
day, at the world’s transfiguration, <i>i.e.</i> when the world is
reality no more, but it has to do with the world as not by
any means annihilated. The man who was moved to seek
what was moral and right, could no longer find it on such
soil, but looked round about him to seek it elsewhere. The
place which was pointed out to him is himself, his
inner life, and external Nature; in the contemplation of
Nature the spirit begins to have a sense of being present
therein.</p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">Revival of the Sciences</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> deeper interest of the subject had been lost sight of,
as we have seen, in the dryness and dulness of the content
of thought, and in speculations which went wandering off
into endless details. But now spirit gathered itself together,
and rose to claim the right to find and know itself
as actual self-consciousness, both in the supersensuous
world and in immediate nature. This awakening of the
self-hood of spirit brought with it the revival of the arts and
sciences of the ancient world. This looked like a falling
back into childhood, but it was really a spontaneous ascent
into the Idea, a movement originating with self—while up
to this time the intellectual world had been rather something
given from without. From this proceeded all efforts
and all inventions, the discovery of America and of the way
to the East Indies. Thus in a very special way the love for
the old, so-called heathen sciences once more awoke, for
men turned to the works of the ancients, which had now
become objects of study, as <i>studia humaniora</i>, where man
is recognized in what concerns himself and in what he
effects. These sciences, though at first they were placed in
opposition to the divine, are rather themselves the divine,
as living, however, in the reality of spirit. Men, because
they are men, find it interesting to study men as men.
With this a further consideration is intimately connected,
namely, that when the formal culture of the mind, found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
among the Scholastics, became transformed into the Universal,
the result necessarily was that thought knew and
found itself in itself; from this the antithesis between the
finite understanding and ecclesiastical dogma or faith consequently
arose. The idea became prevalent that the
understanding can recognize something to be false which
the Church affirms to be true; and it was of importance
that the understanding did so apprehend itself, although it
was in opposition to the positive in general.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c109">A. <span class="smcap">Study of the Ancients.</span></a></h2>

<p>The first way in which the desire to find the human
element in reference to what pertains to science manifested
itself, was that an interest in such matters sprang up in the
West, a receptive power where the ancients in their definiteness
and beauty are concerned. But the revival of the arts
and sciences, and especially of the study of ancient literature
bearing on Philosophy, was at first in some measure a
simple revival of the old philosophy in its earlier and original
form, without anything new being added; this working up of
old philosophies, to which a great number of writings were
devoted, was thus the restoration of something forgotten
only. The study of the Greeks was more especially revived;
the knowledge of the Greek originals which the West
acquired is connected with external political events. The
West kept up constant intercourse with the Greeks through
the Crusades, and Italy did so by means of commerce; yet
there were no special diplomatic relations. Even the
Roman laws were brought back from the East, until a code
of the <i>corpus juris</i> was by chance discovered. But the West
was again, and more effectually, brought into touch with the
Greek East when, on the disastrous fall of the Byzantine
Empire, the noblest and most distinguished of the Greeks
fled to Italy. Earlier than this even, when the Greek
Empire was being harassed by the Turks, ambassadors had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
been sent to the West in order to solicit help. These
ambassadors were men of learning, and by their means—for
as a rule they settled in the West—there was transplanted
thither that love for antiquity to which we have
referred. Petrarch in this way learned Greek from Barlaam,
a monk in Calabria, where dwelt many belonging to
the order of St. Basil; this order had monasteries in the
south of Italy, and used Greek ritual. In Constantinople
Barlaam had made the acquaintance of Greeks, particularly
of Chrysoloras, who from 1395 chose Italy as his permanent
dwelling-place. These Greeks made the West familiar
with the works of the ancients, especially of Plato.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Too
much honour is done to the monks when it is asserted that
they preserved for us the writings of the ancients; these
works, at least such as were in Greek, came rather from
Constantinople, while the Latin portion of them, it is true,
were preserved in the West. Acquaintance was now also
for the first time made with Aristotle’s own writings (<i>supra</i>,
p. 75), and thereby the old philosophies were again revived,
although mingled with intellectual vagaries of the
utmost wildness.</p>

<p>Thus it was partly the old Platonic philosophy that was
sought out, and partly the Neo-Platonic, as also the
Aristotelian and Stoic, the Epicurean as far as it regarded
physics, and the popular philosophy of Cicero in its first
form; these were brought forward as authorities against
Scholasticism, being in direct contradiction to it. Such
endeavours are, however, connected rather with the history
of literature and culture, and with the advancement of the
same; we do not find originality in this philosophic work,
nor can we recognize therein any forward step. We have
still writings of that period, by which we find that each
school of the Greeks found its adherents, and that Aristotelians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Platonists, and so on appeared on the scenes, though
they were of a very different stamp from those of olden
times. For true instruction in philosophy we must, however,
go to the original sources, the ancients.</p>

<h3><a id="c111">1. <span class="smcap">Pomponatius.</span></a></h3>

<p>Pomponatius was one of the most remarkable of these
Aristotelians; among other subjects he wrote in 1534 on
the immortality of the soul, and in so doing he showed—following
a practice which was specially in vogue at that
time—that this dogma, which he believed as a Christian,
was according to Aristotle and reason incapable of proof.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The disciples of Averroës alleged that the universal νοῦς,
which is present in thought, is immaterial and immortal,
while the soul as numerically one is mortal; and Alexander
Aphrodisiensis also maintained its mortality. Both of these
opinions were condemned in 1513 at the Council of Benevento,
under Leo X.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The vegetative and sensitive soul
Pomponatius asserted to be mortal (c. VIII. p. 36; c. IX.
pp. 51, 62-65): and he maintained that it is only through
thought and reason that man partakes of immortality.
Pomponatius was summoned before the Inquisition; but as
cardinals protected him, no further notice was taken of the
matter.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> There were many other pure Aristotelians; especially
among the Protestants at a later time were they
general. The Scholastics were erroneously termed Aristotelians;
therefore the Reformation was opposed to Aristotle
only in appearance, but to the Scholastics it was opposed in
fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="c112a">2. <span class="smcap">Bessarion, Ficinus, Picus.</span></a></h3>

<p>Men now began to form acquaintance more especially
with Plato, when manuscripts of his works were brought
from Greece; Greeks, refugees from Constantinople, gave
lectures on Plato’s philosophy. Cardinal Bessarion of
Trapezunt, at one time Patriarch of Constantinople, was
specially active in making Plato known in the West.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Ficinus, who was born in Florence in 1433, and died in
1499, the accomplished translator of Plato, was a man of
note; it was mainly due to him that the study of Neo-Platonism,
as presented by Proclus and Plotinus, was again
revived. Ficinus wrote also a Platonic Theology. One
of the Medici in Florence, Cosmo II., went so far as to
found a Platonic Academy even in the fifteenth century.
These Medici, the elder Cosmo, Lorenzo, Leo X., Clement
VII., were patrons of all the arts and sciences, and made
their court the resort of classical Greek scholars.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Two counts of the name of Pico della Mirandola—Giovanni,
and Giovanni Francesco, his nephew—were influential
rather by virtue of their marked personality and their
originality; the elder propounded nine hundred theses,
fifty-five of which were taken from Proclus, and invited
philosophers one and all to a solemn discussion of the
same; he also in princely fashion undertook to pay the
travelling expenses of those at a distance.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c112b">3. <span class="smcap">Gassendi, Lipsius, Reuchlin, Helmont.</span></a></h3>

<p>Somewhat later, and specially by Gassendi, the opponent
of Descartes, the atom theory of Epicurus was again revived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
As a development therefrom the theory of molecules
maintained its place thenceforth in physical science.</p>

<p>The revival of Stoic philosophy due to Lipsius was not
so clearly evidenced.</p>

<p>In Reuchlin (Kapnio), who was born at Pforzheim in
Swabia in 1455, and who was himself the translator of
several comedies of Aristophanes, the Cabalistic philosophy
found a defender. He endeavoured also to reconstruct
the Pythagorean philosophy proper; but he
mingled with it much that is vague and mysterious.
There was in hand a project to destroy all Hebrew books
in Germany by an imperial decree, as had been done in
Spain; Reuchlin deserves great credit for having prevented
this.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> On account of the entire lack of dictionaries,
the study of the Greek language was rendered
so difficult that Reuchlin travelled to Vienna for the
purpose of learning Greek from a Greek.</p>

<p>Later on we find many profound thoughts in Helmont,
an Englishman, who was born in 1618, and died in 1699.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>All these philosophies were carried on side by side with
belief in Church dogmas, and without prejudice thereto;
not in the sense in which the ancients conceived them.
A mass of literature exists on this subject, containing the
names of a multitude of philosophers, but it is a literature
of the past, without the vitality characteristic of higher
principles; it is in fact not a true philosophy at all, and
I shall therefore not dwell any longer upon it.</p>

<h3><a id="c113">4. <span class="smcap">Ciceronian Popular Philosophy.</span></a></h3>

<p>Cicero’s mode of philosophizing, a very general mode,
was revived in an especial degree. It is a popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
style of philosophizing, which has no real speculative
value, but in regard to general culture it has this
importance, that in it man derives more from himself as
a whole, from his outer and inner experience, and speaks
altogether from the standpoint of the present. He is a
man of understanding who says,—</p>

<p>“What helps a man in life, is what life itself has taught
him.”</p>

<p>The feelings, &amp;c., of man obtained due recognition, we
must observe, as against the principle of self-abnegation. A
very large number of writings of this kind were issued,
some of them simply on their own account, others aimed
against the Scholastics. Although all that great mass of
philosophical writings—much, for instance, that Erasmus
wrote on similar subjects—has been forgotten, and though
it possesses little intrinsic value, it was still of very great
service, as succeeding the barrenness of the Scholastics and
their groundless maunderings in abstractions:—groundless
I say, for they had not even self-consciousness as their
basis. Petrarch was one of those who wrote from himself,
from his heart, as a thinking man.</p>

<p>This new departure in Philosophy applies in this regard
to the reform of the Church by Protestantism also. Its
principle is simply this, that it led man back to himself,
and removed what was alien to him, in language especially.
To have translated for German Christians the book on
which their faith is grounded, into their mother-tongue, is
one of the greatest revolutions which could have happened.
Italy in the same way obtained grand poetic works when the
vernacular came to be employed by such writers as Dante,
Boccaccio and Petrarch; Petrarch’s political works were
however written in Latin. It is not until a thing is
expressed in my mother tongue that it becomes my own
possession. Luther and Melancthon cast the Scholastic
element quite aside, and drew their conclusions from the
Bible, from faith, from the human heart. Melancthon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
presents to us a calm popular philosophy, in which the
human element makes itself felt, and which therefore forms
the most striking contrast to the lifeless and jejune
Scholasticism. This attack against the Scholastic method
was made in the most different directions and in the
most various forms. But all this belongs rather to the
history of Religion than to that of Philosophy.</p>

<h2><a id="c115">B. <span class="smcap">Certain Attempts in Philosophy.</span></a></h2>

<p>A second series of writers who now appeared have
mainly to do with particular attempts made in Philosophy
which remained attempts merely, and are only found while
this terrible time of upheaval lasted. Many individuals of
that period saw themselves forsaken by what had hitherto
been accepted by them as content, by the object which up
to this time had formed the stay and support of their consciousness—by
faith. Side by side with the peaceful reappearance
of the ancient philosophy there displayed itself,
on the other hand, a multitude of individuals in whom a
burning desire after the conscious knowledge of what is
deepest and most concrete was violently manifested. It
was spoilt, however, by endless fancies, extravagances of
the imagination and a craze for secret, astrological, geomantic
and other knowledge. These men felt themselves
dominated, as they really were, by the impulse to create
existence and to derive truth from their very selves. They
were men of vehement nature, of wild and restless character,
of enthusiastic temperament, who could not attain
to the calm of knowledge. Though it cannot be denied
that there was in them a wonderful insight into what was
true and great, there is no doubt on the other hand that
they revelled in all manner of corruption in thought and
heart as well as in their outer life. There is thus to be
found in them great originality and subjective energy of
spirit; at the same time the content is heterogeneous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
unequal, and their confusion of mind is great. Their fate,
their lives, their writings—which often fill many volumes—manifest
only this restlessness of their being, this tearing
asunder, the revolt of their inner being against present
existence and the longing to get out of it and reach certainty.
These remarkable individuals really resemble the
upheavals, tremblings and eruptions of a volcano which
has become worked up in its depths and has brought forth
new developments, which as yet are wild and uncontrolled.
The most outstanding men of this nature are Cardanus,
Bruno, Vanini, Campanella, and lastly Ramus. They are
representative of the character of the time in this interval of
transition, and fall within the period of the Reformation.</p>

<h3><a id="c116">1. <span class="smcap">Cardanus.</span></a></h3>

<p>Hieronymus Cardanus is of their number; he was remarkable
as an individual of world-wide reputation, in whom
the upheaval and fermentation of his time manifested itself
in its utmost violence. His writings fill ten folio volumes.
Cardanus was born in 1501 at Pavia, and died at Rome in
1575. He recounted his own history and described his
character in his book <i>De vita propria</i>, where he makes an
extraordinary confession of his sins, passing the severest
possible judgment upon them. The following may serve to
give a picture of these contradictions. His life was a series
of the most varied misfortunes, external and domestic. He
speaks first of his pre-natal history. He relates that his
mother, when pregnant with him, drank potions in order
to produce abortion. When he was still at the breast, there
was an outbreak of the plague; the nurse who suckled him
died of the pestilence, he survived. His father was very
severe in his treatment of him. He lived sometimes in the
most crushing poverty and the utmost want, sometimes in the
greatest luxury. Afterwards he applied himself to science,
became a Doctor of Medicine, and travelled much. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was celebrated far and wide; summons came to him from
every quarter, several times he was called to Scotland. He
writes that he cannot tell the sums of money that were
offered to him. He was professor at Milan, first of mathematics
and then of medicine; after that he lay for two
years in Bologna in the strictest imprisonment, and had to
undergo the most frightful tortures. He was a profound
astrologer, and predicted the future for many princes, who
on that account held him in the greatest awe and reverence.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
He is a name of note in mathematics; we have
from him still the <i>regula Cardani</i> for the solution of equations
of the third degree, the only rule we have had up to
this time.</p>

<p>He lived his whole life in perpetual inward and outward
storms. He says that he suffered the greatest torments in
his soul. In this inward agony he found the greatest
delight in inflicting torture both on himself and others.
He scourged himself, bit his lips, pinched himself violently,
distorted his fingers, in order to free himself from the
tortures of his spiritual disquietude and induce weeping,
which brought him relief. The same contradictions were
to be seen in his outward demeanour, which was sometimes
quiet and decorous, while at other times he behaved as if
he were crazy and demented, and that without any external
provocation whatever, and in matters the most indifferent.
Sometimes he put on decent clothes and made himself neat
and trim, at other times he went in rags. He would be
reserved, diligent, persevering in his work, and then would
break out into excesses, wasting and squandering all that
he had, his household goods and his wife’s jewels. Sometimes
he would walk quietly along, like other men; at other
times he would rush on as if he were mad. The upbringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of his children, as was quite to be expected under the
circumstances, was very bad. He had the unhappiness of
seeing his sons turn out ill; one of them poisoned his own
wife and was executed with the sword; he had his second
son’s ears cut off, to chastise him for being dissipated.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>He himself was of the wildest temperament, brooding
deeply within himself, and yet breaking out into violence
in the most contradictory manner; within him there also
raged a consuming restlessness. I have epitomized the
description which he gives of his own character, and now
quote it: “I have by nature a mind of philosophic and
scientific cast; I am witty, elegant, well-bred, fond of
luxury, cheerful, pious, faithful, a lover of wisdom, reflective,
enterprising, studious, obliging, emulous, inventive,
self-taught. I have a longing to perform prodigies, I am
crafty, cunning, bitter, versed in secrets, sober, diligent,
careless, talkative, contemptuous of religion, vindictive,
envious, melancholy, malicious, treacherous, a sorcerer, a
magician, unhappy; I am surly to my family, ascetic, difficult
to deal with, harsh, a soothsayer, jealous, a ribald
talker, a slanderer, compliant, inconstant; such contradictoriness
of nature and manners is to be found in me.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>His writings are in parts just as utterly unequal as his
character. In them he gave vent to the wild vehemence of
his nature; they are disconnected and contradictory, and
were often written in the direst poverty. They contain a
medley of all kinds of astrological and chiromantic superstition,
yet lit up here and there with profound and brilliant
flashes; there are Alexandrine and Cabalistic mysteries side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
by side with perfectly lucid psychological observations of
his own. He treated astrologically the life and deeds of
Christ. His positive merit consists, however, rather in the
stimulus which he gave to original production, and in this
direction he exercised an important influence on his times.
He boasted of the originality and novelty of his ideas, and
the craze to be original drove him to the strangest devices.
This represents the first form taken by the newly awakened
and energizing reason in its spontaneous activity; to be new
and different from others was regarded as tantamount to
possessing a private claim to science.</p>

<h3><a id="c119a">2. <span class="smcap">Campanella.</span></a></h3>

<p>Tommaso Campanella, a student of Aristotle, represents
just such another medley of all possible dispositions. He
was born at Stilo, in Calabria, in 1568, and died at Paris
in 1639. Many of his writings still remain to us. For
seven-and-twenty years of his life he was kept in strict imprisonment
at Naples.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Such men as he aroused enormous
interest and gave great offence, but on their own account
they were productive of very little result. We have still to
make special mention of Giordano Bruno and Vanini as
belonging to this period.</p>

<h3><a id="c119b">3. <span class="smcap">Bruno.</span></a></h3>

<p>Giordano Bruno was of an equally restless and effervescent
temperament, and we see in him a bold rejection of all
Catholic beliefs resting on mere authority. In modern
times he has again been brought into remembrance by
Jacobi (Werke, Vol. IV. Section II. pp. 5-46), who appended
to his letters on Spinoza an abstract of one of Bruno’s
works.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Jacobi caused great attention to be paid to Bruno,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
more especially by his assertion that the sum of Bruno’s
teaching was the One and All of Spinoza, or really Pantheism;
on account of the drawing of this parallel Bruno obtained a
reputation which passes his deserts. He was less restless
than Cardanus; but he had no fixed habitation on the earth.
He was born at Nola in the province of Naples, and lived in
the sixteenth century; the year of his birth is not known
with certainty. He roamed about in most of the European
states, in Italy, France, England, Germany, as a teacher of
philosophy: he forsook Italy, where at one time he had been
a Dominican friar, and where he had made bitter reflections
both upon various Catholic dogmas—for instance, on transubstantiation
and the immaculate conception of the Virgin—and
upon the gross ignorance and scandalous lives of the
monks. He then lived in Geneva in 1582, but there he
fell out in the same way with Calvin and Beza, and could
not live with them: he made some stay in several other
French cities, such as Lyons; and after a time he came to
Paris, where in 1585 he formally challenged the adherents
of Aristotle, by following a practice greatly in favour in
those days (<i>supra</i>, p. 112), and proposing for public disputation
a series of philosophic theses, which were specially
directed against Aristotle. They appeared under the title
<i>Jord. Bruni Nol. Rationes articulorum physicorum adversus
Peripateticos Parisiis propositorum, Vitebergæ apud Zachariam
Cratonem, 1588</i>; he was not successful in them, however,
as the position of the Aristotelians was still too well
assured. Bruno was also in London; he visited Wittenberg
in the year 1586; he likewise stayed in Prague and other
universities and towns. In Helmstedt he was high in the
favour of the Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1589; after
that he went to Frankfort-on-Main, where he had several of
his works printed. He was a wandering professor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
author. Finally he came back to Italy in 1592, and lived
in Padua for some time undisturbed, but at last he was
seized in Venice by the Inquisition, cast into prison, sent
on to Rome, and there in the year 1600, refusing to recant,
he was burned at the stake as a heretic. Eye-witnesses,
and amongst them Scioppius, recount that he met death
with the most unflinching courage. He had become a
Protestant when in Germany, and had broken the vows of
his order.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Among both Catholics and Protestants his writings were
held to be heretical and atheistic, and therefore they were
burned and destroyed, or kept in concealment. His
complete works are hence very seldom met with; the
greatest number of them are to be found in the University
Library at Gottingen; the fullest account of them is
given in Buhle’s History of Philosophy (<i>supra</i>, Vol. I. p.
113). His works are for the most part rare, and in many
cases interdicted; in Dresden they are still included among
prohibited writings, and are therefore not to be seen there.
Lately<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> an edition of them in the Italian language was
prepared,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> which possibly has never yet been issued.
Bruno also wrote a great deal in Latin. Wherever he took
up his abode for a time, he gave public lectures, wrote and
published works; and this increases the difficulty of
making complete acquaintance with his books. Many of
his writings are for the above reason very similar in their
matter, the form only being different, and in the evolution
of his thoughts he never consequently advanced very much
nor attained to any results. But the leading characteristic
of his various writings is really to some extent the grand
enthusiasm of a noble soul, which has a sense of indwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
spirit, and knows the unity of its own Being and all Being
to be the whole life of thought. There is something
bacchantic in his way of apprehending this deep consciousness;
it overflows in becoming thus an object of thought,
and in the expression of its riches. But it is only in
knowledge that spirit can bring itself forth as a whole;
when it has not yet attained to this point of scientific
culture, it reaches out after all forms, without bringing
them first into due order. Bruno displays just such an
unregulated and multiform profusion; and on that account
his expositions have frequently a dreamy, confused,
allegorical appearance of mystical enthusiasm. Many of
his writings are in verse, and much that is fantastic finds a
place in them, as for instance when he says in one of his
works, entitled <i>La Bestia Trionfante</i>, that something else
must be put in place of the stars.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> He sacrificed his
personal welfare to the great enthusiasm which filled him,
and which left him no peace. It is easy to say that he was
“a restless being, who could get on with nobody.” But
whence did this restlessness come to him? What he could
not get on with was the finite, the evil, the ignoble.
Thence arose his restlessness. He rose to the one universal
substantiality by putting an end to this separation of self-consciousness
and nature, whereby both alike are degraded.
God was in self-consciousness, it was admitted, but
externally, and as remaining something different from self-consciousness,
another reality; while Nature was made by
God, being His creature, not an image of Him. The goodness
of God displayed itself only in final causes, finite ends,
as when it is said: “Bees make honey for man’s food; the
cork tree grows to provide stoppers for bottles.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>As to his reflections, Jacobi has by his recent<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> exposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of them made it seem as if it were a theory specially
characteristic of Bruno that one living Being, one
World-Soul, should penetrate all existence, and should
be the life of all. Bruno asserted, in the first place,
the unity of life and the universality of the World-Soul,
and, in the second place, the indwelling presence of
reason; but Bruno in so saying is far from being original,
and in fact this doctrine is a mere echo of the Alexandrian.
But in his writings there are two specially marked features.
The first is the nature of his system, based as it is on his
leading thoughts, or his philosophic principles generally,
namely the Idea as substantial unity. The second, which
is closely connected with the first, is his use of the
<i>Art</i> of Lullius; this is specially emphasized and highly
esteemed by him, the art of finding differences in the Idea:
it he wished to bring into special recognition.</p>

<p>a. His philosophic thoughts, to express which he sometimes
made use of Aristotle’s concepts, give evidence of a
peculiar, highly strung and very original mind. The
substance of his general reflections is found in the greatest
enthusiasm for the above-mentioned vitality of Nature,
divinity, the presence of reason in nature. His philosophy
is thus on the whole certainly Spinozism, Pantheism.
The separation of man from God or the world, all such
relations of externality, have been superadded to his living
idea of the absolute, universal unity of all things, for the
expression of which idea Bruno has been so greatly
admired. In his conception of things the main points are
that, on the one hand, he gives the universal determination
of matter, and, on the other hand, that of form.</p>

<p>α. The unity of life he thus determines as the universal,
active understanding (νοῦς), which manifests itself
as the universal form of all the world, and comprehends
all forms in itself; it bears the same relation to the
production of natural objects as does the understanding of
man, and moulds and systematizes them, as the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
understanding moulds the multitude of its concepts. It is
the artist within, who shapes and forms the material without.
From within the root or the seed-grain it makes the
shoot come forth; from this again it brings the branches,
and from them the twigs, and from out of the twigs it calls
forth the buds, and leaves, and flowers. All is planned,
prepared and perfected within. In the same way this
universal reason within calls back their saps from the fruits
and blossoms to the twigs, and so on. The universe is
thus an infinite animal, in which all things live and move
and have their being in modes the most diverse. The
formal understanding is thus in no wise different from the
Final Cause (the Notion of end, the entelechy, the unmoved
principle, which we meet with in Aristotle); but these are
just as truly also active understanding, the efficient cause
(<i>causa efficiens</i>), this same producing force. Nature and
Spirit are not separated; their unity is the formal understanding,
in which is contained the pure Notion, not as in
consciousness, but as free and independent, remaining
within itself, and at the same time exercising activity and
passing beyond itself. The understanding working towards
one particular end is the inward form of the thing itself,
an inward principle of the understanding. What is continually
produced is in accordance with this form, and contained
within it; what appears is determined as the form is
in itself determined.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> With Proclus in the same way the
understanding, as substantial, is that which includes all
things in its unity: life is the outgoing, the producing
force: and the understanding as such similarly includes
the returning force, which brings all things back into
unity. In dealing with Kant’s philosophy we shall have
again to mention this determination of final purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
That which has organic life, whose principle is formative,
which has its efficacy in itself, and in the same only
remains at home with itself and maintains itself, is nothing
but the end, the activity determined in itself, which in its
relation to what is different does not comport itself as
mere cause, but returns upon itself.</p>

<p>β. Bruno, who asserts the final cause to be immediately
operative, and the life immanent in the universe, asserts
it also to be existent, as substance; he is therefore
opposed to the conception of a merely extra-mundane
understanding. To a certain extent Bruno distinguishes
form and matter in substance, which itself, as the aforesaid
activity of the Idea, is the unity of form and matter;
thus matter has life in itself. The permanent element in
the endless changes of existence is, he says, the first and
absolute matter; although without form, it is nevertheless
the mother of all forms, and receptive of all forms.
Because matter is not without the first universal form, it
is itself principle or in itself final cause. Form is immanent
in matter; the one simply cannot exist without
the other; thus matter itself brings about these changes
of form, and the same matter runs through them all.
What was at first seed becomes blade, then ear, then bread,
chyle, blood, seed of animal, an embryo, a human being,
a corpse, then once more earth, stone, or other substance;
from sand and water frogs are produced. Here then we
can perceive something which, although it transforms
itself into all these things in turn, yet still in itself remains
one and the same. This matter cannot be a body, for
bodies have form; nor can it belong to the class which
we term properties, attributes, or qualities, for these are
liable to change. Thus nothing seems to be eternal and
worthy of the name of a principle, except matter. Many
have for this reason held matter to be the only reality, and
all forms to be accidental. This error arises from the fact
of their recognizing only a form of the second kind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
not that necessary first and eternal form, which is the
form and source of all forms. In the same way
the aforesaid matter, on account of its identity with the
understanding which causes form beforehand, is itself
intelligible, as the universal presupposition of all corporeality.
Because it is everything in general, it is nothing
in particular, neither air nor water, nor anything else,
abstract or otherwise; it has no dimensions, in order to
have all dimensions. The forms of matter are the inward
power of matter itself; it is, as intelligible, the very
totality of form.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This system of Bruno’s is thus objective
Spinozism, and nothing else; one can see how deeply he
penetrated.</p>

<p>Bruno here asks the question: “But this first universal
form and that first universal matter, how are they united,
inseparable? Different—and yet one Being?” He answers
by making use of the Aristotelian forms of δύναμις
and ἐνέργεια: Matter is to be regarded as potentiality;
in this way all possible forms of existence in a certain
sense are included in the Notion of it. The passivity of
matter must be regarded as pure and absolute. Now
it is impossible to attribute existence to a thing which
lacks the power to exist. Existence has, however, such
an express reference to the active mode, that it is at
once clear that the one cannot exist without the other, but
that each of them presupposes the other. If therefore at
all times a capacity of working, producing, creating, was
there, so must there also have been at all times a capacity
of being worked upon, produced, created. The perfect
potentiality of the existence of things (matter) cannot precede
their actual existence, and just as little can it remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
after that is past. The first and most perfect principle
includes all existence in itself, can be all things, and is all
things. Active power and potentiality, possibility and
actuality are therefore in it one undivided and indivisible
principle.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This simultaneousness of acting and being acted
upon is a very important determination; matter is nothing
without activity, form is therefore the power and inward
life of matter. If matter were nothing but indeterminate
potentiality, how would the determinate be arrived at?
This simplicity of matter is itself only one moment of form:
in wishing therefore to tear asunder matter and form, matter
is at once established in one determination of form, but in
so doing there is immediately established also the existence
of the Other.</p>

<p>Thus the Absolute is determined for Bruno: it is not so
with other things, which may exist and also may not exist,
and which may be determined in one way or in another
way. In regard to finite things and in finite determinations
of the understanding the distinction between form
and matter is thus present. The individual man is at every
moment what he may be at that moment, but not everything
which he may be in general and with reference to
substance. The things which appear to be different are
only modifications of one single thing which includes in its
existence all other existence. The universe, unbegotten
Nature, is, however, everything which it can be in reality
and at one time, because it includes in itself the whole of
matter, as well as the eternal, unchangeable form of its
changing forms. But in its developments from moment to
moment, its particular parts, qualities, individual existences,
in its externality as a whole, it is no more what it is and
may be; but a part such as this is only a shadow of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
image of the first principle.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Thus Bruno wrote also a
book, <i>De umbris idearum</i>.</p>

<p>γ. This is Bruno’s fundamental idea. He says: “To
recognize this unity of form and matter in all things, is
what reason is striving to attain to. But in order to penetrate
to this unity, in order to investigate all the secrets of
Nature, we must search into the opposed and contradictory
extremes of things, the maximum and the minimum.” It
is in these very extremes that they are intelligible, and become
united in the Notion; and this union of them is infinite
Nature. “To find the point of union is not the greatest
matter; but to develop from the same its very opposite,
this is the real and the deepest secret of the art.”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It is
saying much if we speak of knowing the development of the
Idea as a necessity of determinations; we shall see later
how Bruno proceeded to do this. He represents the
original principle, which is elsewhere known as the form,
under the Notion of the minimum, which is at the same
time the maximum—One, which at the same time is All;
the universe is this One in All. In the universe, he says,
the body is not distinguished from the point, nor the centre
from the circumference, nor the finite from the infinite, nor
the maximum from the minimum. There is nothing but
centre point; or the centre point is everywhere and in
everything. The ancients expressed the same by saying of
the Father of the gods, that he really had his dwelling-place
in every point of the universe. It is the universe that first
gives to things true reality; it is the substance of all things,
the monad, the atom, the spirit poured out on all things,
the innermost essence, the pure form.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>b. The second object to which Bruno devoted himself was
the so-called Lullian Art, which received its name from its
first inventor, the Scholastic Raymundus Lullus (<i>supra</i>, pp.
92-94). Bruno adopted this and carried it to completion;
he termed it also his <i>ars combinatoria</i>. This art is in some
respects like what we met with in Aristotle under the name
of the Topics (Vol. II. pp. 217, 218), seeing that both give
an immense number of “places” and determinations which
were fixed in the conception like a table with its divisions, in
order that these headings might be applied to all that came
to hand. But the Topics of Aristotle did this in order to
apprehend and determine an object in its various aspects,
while Bruno rather worked for the sake of lightening the task
of memory. He thus really connected the Lullian Art with
the art of mnemonics as practised by the ancients, which
has come into notice again in recent times, and which will
be found described in greater detail in the <i>Auctor ad Herennium</i>
(Libr. III. c. 17, <i>sqq.</i>). To give an example: one establishes
for oneself a certain number of different departments
in the imagination, which are to be chosen at pleasure;
there may be perhaps twelve of these, arranged in sets of
three, and indicated by certain words, such as Aaron,
Abimelech, Achilles, Berg, Baum, Baruch, etc., into which
divisions one inserts, as it were, what has to be learnt by
heart, and forms it into a succession of pictures. In this
way when we repeat it, we have not to say it from memory
or out of our head, as we are accustomed to do, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
we have only to read it off as if from a table. The only
difficulty lies in making some ingenious connection between
the content in question and the picture; that gives rise to
the most unholy combinations, and the art is therefore not
one to be commended. Bruno also soon abandoned it, since
what had been a matter of memory became a matter of
imagination; which was, of course, a descent. But since
with Bruno the diagram is not only a picture of external
images, but a system of universal determinations of thought,
he certainly gave to this art a deeper inward meaning.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>α. Bruno passes over to this art from universal ideas
which are given. Since namely one life, one understanding
is in all things, Bruno had the dim hope of apprehending
this universal understanding in the totality of its determinations,
and of subsuming all things under it—of setting
up a logical philosophy by its means, and making it applicable
in all directions.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> He says: The object of consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
therein is the universe, in so far as it enters into the
relation of the true, the knowable and the rational. Like
Spinoza he distinguishes between the intelligible thing of
reason and the actual thing: As metaphysics has for object
the universal thing, which is divided into substance and
accident, so the chief matter is that there is a single and more
universal art which knits together and compasses round the
thing of reason and the actual thing, and recognizes them
both as harmonizing with one another, so that the many, be
they of what kind they may, are led back to simple unity.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>β. For Bruno the principle in all this is the understanding
generally: None other than the understanding whose
activity extends beyond itself, which brings into existence
the sensuous world. It is related to the illumination of the
spirit as the sun is related to the eye: it relates therefore to
a phenomenal manifold, illuminating this, not itself. The
Other is the active understanding in itself, which is related
to the objects of thought in their various classes, as the eye
is to things visible.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The infinite form, the active understanding
which dwells in reason, is the first, the principle,
which develops; the process in some respects resembles
what was met with in the Neo-Platonists. Bruno’s great
endeavour is really now to apprehend and demonstrate the
modes of organizing this active understanding.</p>

<p>γ. This is presented more in detail as follows: To the pure
truth itself, the absolute light, man approaches only; his
Being is not absolute Being itself, which alone is the One
and First. He rests only under the shadow of the Idea,
whose purity is the light, but which at the same time partakes
of the darkness. The light of substance emanates
from this pure First Light, the light of accident emanates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
from the light of substance. This we met with also in
Proclus (<i>supra</i>, Vol. II. p. 446) as the third moment
in the first triad. This absolute principle in its unity
is for Bruno the first matter, and the first act of this
principle he names the original light (<i>actus primus
lucis</i>). But substances and accidents, which are
many, cannot receive the full light, they are therefore
only included in the shadow of the light; in like
manner the ideas also are only shadows thereof.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The
development of Nature goes on from moment to moment;
created things are only a shadow of the first principle, not
the first principle itself.</p>

<p>δ. Bruno continues: From this super-essential (<i>super-essentiale</i>)—an
expression which is also met with in Proclus
(<i>supra</i>, Vol. II. p. 441)—advance is made to the essences,
from the essences to that which is, from that which is
to their traces, images and shadows, and that in a
double direction: both towards matter, in order to be
produced within her (these shadows are then present
in natural fashion), and also towards sensation and
reason, in order to be known by means of these. Things
withdraw themselves from the First Light towards the
darkness. But since all things in the universe are in
close connection, the lower with the middle, and those
with the upper, the compound with the simple, the
simple with those which are more simple, the material with
the spiritual, in order that there may be one universe, one
order and government of the same, one principle and aim,
one first and last; so, following the sound of the lyre of the
universal Apollo (an expression which we saw used by
Heraclitus, Vol. I. pp. 284, 285), the lower can be led back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
step by step to the higher, as fire was condensed and
transformed into air, air into water, water into earth. Thus
One Being is in all. That process is the same as this
return, and they form a circle. Nature within her limits
can produce all from all, and so the understanding can
also know all from all.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>ε. The unity of opposites is explained more in detail as
follows: The diversity of shadows is no real opposition.
In the same conception the opposites are known, the
beautiful and the ugly, the appropriate and the inappropriate,
the perfect and the imperfect, the good and the
evil. Imperfection, evil, ugliness, do not rest upon special
ideas of their own; they become known in another
conception, not in one peculiar to themselves, which is
nothing. For this that is peculiarly theirs is the non-existent
in the existent, the defect in the effect. The first
understanding is the original light; it streams its light out
of the innermost to the outermost, and draws it again
from the outermost to itself. Every Being can, according
to its capacity, appropriate somewhat of this light.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>ζ. The real element in things is just that which is intelligible,
not that which is perceived or felt, or what is
peculiar to the individual; whatever else is termed real, the
sensuous, is non-Being. All that comes to pass beneath
the sun, all that dwells in the region of matter, falls under
the notion of vanity (finitude). Seek to take from Ideas
a firm basis for thy conceptions, if thou art wise. The pure
light of things is nothing but this knowableness, which
proceeds from the first understanding and is directed towards
it; the non-existent is not known. What is here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
contrast and diversity, is in the first understanding
harmony and unity. Try therefore if thou canst identify
the images thou hast received, if thou canst harmonize
and unite them; thus thou wilt not render thy mind
weary, thy thoughts obscure, and thy memory confused.
Through the idea which is in the understanding a
better conception of anything will be formed than by means
of the form of the natural thing in itself, because this
last is more material: but that conception is reached in a
supreme degree through the idea of the object as it
exists in the divine understanding.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The differences
which are here given, are therefore no differences at all;
but all is harmony. To develop this was therefore
Bruno’s endeavour; and the determinations, as natural in
that divine understanding, correspond with those which
appear in the subjective understanding. Bruno’s art
consists only in determining the universal scheme of form,
which includes all things within itself, and in showing how
its moments express themselves in the different spheres
of existence.</p>

<p>η. The main endeavour of Bruno was thus to represent
the All and One, after the method of Lullus, as a system of
classes of regular determinations. Hence in the manner of
Proclus he specifies the three spheres: First, the original
form (ὑπερουσία) as the originator of all forms; secondly, the
physical world, which impresses the traces of the Ideas on
the surface of matter, and multiplies the original picture
in countless mirrors set face to face; thirdly, the form of
the rational world, which individualizes numerically for the
senses the shadows of the Ideas, brings them into one, and
raises them to general conceptions for the understanding.
The moments of the original form itself are termed Being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
goodness (nature or life), and unity. (Something similar
to this we also met with in Proclus, Vol. II. p. 445) In
the metaphysical world the original form is thing, good,
principle of plurality (<i>ante multa</i>); in the physical world
it manifests itself in things, goods, individuals; in the
rational world of knowledge it is derived from things,
goods and individuals.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Unity is the agent that brings
them back once more; and Bruno, while distinguishing the
natural and metaphysical world, seeks to set up the system
of the above determinations, in order to show at once how
the same thing is in one way a natural appearance, and in
another way an object existing for thought.</p>

<p>Since Bruno sought to apprehend this connection more
closely, he considers thinking as a subjective art and
activity of the soul, representing inwardly and in accordance
with the ordinary conception, as it were through an
inward writing, what Nature represents externally, as it
were, through an outward writing. Thinking, he says, is
the capability both of receiving into one’s self this external
writing of nature and of imagining and substantiating the
inward writing in the outward. This art of thinking inwardly
and organizing outwardly in accordance with the
same, and the capacity to reverse the process—an art
possessed by the soul of man—Bruno places in the closest
connection with the art of the nature of the universe, with
the energy of the absolute World-principle, by means of
which all is formed and fashioned. It is one form which
develops; it is the same world-principle which causes form
in metals, plants and animals, and which in man thinks
and organizes outside himself, only that it expresses itself
in its operations in an endlessly varied manner throughout
the entire world. Inwardly and outwardly there is consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
one and the same development of one and the
same principle.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>In his <i>Ars Lulliana</i> Bruno made the attempt to determine
and systematize these various writings of the soul, by
means of which also the organizing world-principle reveals
itself. He assumes therein twelve principal kinds of
writing, or classes of natural forms, to form a starting-point:
“<i>Species, Formæ, Simulacra, Imagines, Spectra,
Exemplaria, Indicia, Signa, Notæ, Characteres et Sigilli</i>.
Some kinds of writing are connected with the external
sense, like external forms, pictures and ideals (<i>extrinseca
forma, imago, exemplar</i>); these painting and other plastic
arts represent, by imitating Mother Nature. Some are connected
with the inner sense, where—with regard to mass,
duration, number—they are magnified, extended in time
and multiplied; such are the products of fancy. Some are
connected with a common point of similarity in several
things; some are so divergent from the objective nature of
things that they are quite imaginary. Finally, some appear
to be peculiar to art, as <i>signa, notæ, characteres et sigilli</i>;
by means of these the powers of art are so great that it
seems to be able to act independently of Nature, beyond
Nature, and, when the matter in question involves it, even
against Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>So far all, on the whole, goes well; it is the carrying
out of the same scheme in all directions. All respect is
due to this attempt to represent the logical system of the
inward artist, the producing thought, in such a way that the
forms of external Nature correspond thereto. But while
the system of Bruno is otherwise a grand one, in it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
determinations of thought nevertheless at once become
superficial, or mere dead types, as in later times was the case
with the classification of natural philosophy; for Bruno
merely enumerates the moments and contrasts of the
system, just as the natural philosophers developed the
three-fold character in every sphere, regarded as absolute.
Further or more determinate moments Bruno has done
nothing more than collect together; when he tries to represent
them by figures and classifications, the result is confusion.
The twelve forms laid down as basis neither have their
derivation traced nor are they united in one entire system,
nor is the further multiplication deduced. To this part
of his subject he devoted several of his writings (<i>De sigillis</i>),
and in different works it is presented in different ways;
the appearances of things are as letters, or symbols,
which correspond with thoughts. The idea is on the whole
praiseworthy compared with the fragmentariness of Aristotle
and the Scholastics, according to whom every determination
is fixed once for all. But the carrying out of the
idea is in part allied with the Pythagorean numbers, and
consequently unmethodical and arbitrary; and in part we
find metaphorical, allegorical combinations and couplings,
where we cannot follow Bruno; in this attempt to introduce
order, all things are mingled together in the wildest
disorder.</p>

<p>It is a great beginning, to have the thought of unity;
and the other point is this attempt to grasp the universe in
its development, in the system of its determinations, and to
show how the outward appearance is a symbol of ideas.
These are the two aspects of Bruno’s teaching which had to
be taken into consideration.</p>

<h3><a id="c137">4. <span class="smcap">Vanini.</span></a></h3>

<p>Julius Cæsar Vanini has also to be mentioned as belonging
to this period; his first name was really Lucilius. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
has many points of similarity with Bruno, and, like him, he
suffered as a martyr on account of philosophy; for he
shared Bruno’s fate, which was to be burned at the stake.
He was born in 1586 at Taurozano in the province of
Naples. He wandered from country to country; we find
him in Geneva, and then in Lyons, whence he fled to
England in order to save himself from the Inquisition.
After two years he returned to Italy. In Genoa he taught
Natural Philosophy on the system of Averroës, but did not
bring himself into favour. In his travels he met with all
manner of strange adventures, and engaged in many and
various disputations on philosophy and theology. He
became more and more an object of suspicion, and fled
from Paris; he was summoned before the tribunal on a
charge of impiety, not of heresy. Franconus, his accuser,
stated on oath that Vanini had uttered blasphemies.
Vanini protested that he had remained faithful to the
Catholic Church, and to his belief in the Trinity; and in
answer to the charge of atheism he took up a straw from
the ground in the presence of his judges, and said that
even this straw would convince him of the existence of
God. But it was of no avail; in 1619 at Toulouse in
France he was condemned to the stake, and before the
carrying out of this sentence his tongue was torn out
by the executioner. How the case was proved against
him is not, however, clear; the proceedings seem to
have been in great part due to personal enmity, and to
the zeal for persecution which filled the clergy in Toulouse.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Vanini derived his chief stimulus from the originality of
Cardanus. In him we see reason and philosophy taking a
direction hostile to theology, while Scholastic philosophy
went hand in hand with theology, and theology was supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to be confirmed thereby. Art developed in the
Catholic Church, but free thought broke off from, and
remained alien to it. In Bruno and Vanini the Church
took her revenge for this; she renounced science, and took
up a position of hostility to it.</p>

<p>Vanini’s philosophy does not go very far; he admires
the living energy of Nature; his reasonings were not deep,
but were more of the nature of fanciful ideas. He always
chose the dialogue form; and it is not evident which of
the opinions stated are his own. He wrote commentaries
on Aristotle’s works on Physics. We have two other
works by Vanini, which are very rare. The one is styled:
<i>Amphitheatrum æternæ providentiæ divino-magicum, christiano-physicum,
nec non astrologo-catholicum, adversus
veteres philosophos, Atheos, Epicureos, Peripateticos et
Stoicos. Auctore Julio Cæsare Vanino, Lugd. 1615</i>; in this
he gives a very eloquent account of all these philosophies
and their principles, but the manner in which he refutes
them is rather feeble. The second work is entitled “On
the Wonderful Secrets of Nature, the Queen and Goddess of
Mortals” (<i>De admirandis Naturæ, reginæ Deæque mortalium,
arcanis libr. IV., Lutetiæ 1616</i>); it was printed “with
the approval of the Sorbonne,” which at first found in it
nothing “which contradicted and was hostile to the Catholic
Apostolic and Roman religion.” It contains scientific
investigations into various matters belonging to physics
and natural history, and is also in dialogue form, without
definite indication being given as to which of the characters
is made the mouthpiece of Vanini’s own opinions. What one
finds is assurances from him that he would believe this or
that doctrine if he had not received Christian teaching.
Vanini’s tendency, however, was towards naturalism; he
showed that it is Nature that is the Deity, that all things
had a mechanical genesis. He therefore explained the
whole universe in its connection by efficient causes alone,
not by final causes; but the statement of this is made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
such a way that the writer does not give it as his own
conclusion.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Thus Vanini placed reason in opposition to faith and
church dogma, as had already been done by Pomponatius
(<i>supra</i>, p. 111) and others. Yet all the time that they
were proving by reason this or that dogma which is in
direct contradiction to the Christian belief, they were
declaring that they submitted their conviction to the
Church—a course which was always adopted by Bayle
afterwards in the reformed church. Another practice of
these philosophers was to bring forward all sorts of
arguments and theories contradictory of theological
dogmas, as so many insoluble difficulties and contradictions
brought about by reason, which were, however, by them
submitted to faith. Thus, for instance, Bayle says in the
article “Manichæans” found in his critical <i>Dictionnaire</i>—in
which he touches on many philosophic conceptions—that
the assertion of the existence of two principles cannot be
disproved, but that we must submit herein to the Church.
In this fashion all possible arguments were advanced against
the Church. Vanini thus states objections against the
Atonement, and brings forward arguments to prove that
Nature is God. Now men were convinced that reason
could not be contradictory of the Christian dogmas, and
no faith was placed in the sincerity of a submission which
consisted in giving up what one was convinced of by
reason; therefore Galileo, because he defended the system
of Copernicus, had to recant on his knees, and Vanini was
burned at the stake. Both of them had in vain chosen the
dialogue form for their writings.</p>

<p>Vanini certainly made one of the speakers in the Dialogues
prove (<i>De naturæ arcanis</i>, p. 420) even “out of the text
of the Bible, that the devil is mightier than God,” and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
therefore God does not rule the world. Among his arguments
are the following: It was against the will of God
that Adam and Eve sinned, and thus brought the whole
human race to ruin (<i>ad interitum</i>): Christ also was crucified
by the powers of darkness. Moreover it is the will of God
that all men should be saved. But of Catholics there
are very few in comparison with the rest of the world,
and the Jews often fell away from their faith; the Catholic
religion extends only over Spain, France, Italy, Poland
and a part of Germany. If there were to be deducted
also the atheists, blasphemers, heretics, whoremongers,
adulterers, and so on, there would be still fewer left.
Consequently the devil is mightier than God. These are
arguments of reason; they are not to be refuted; but he
submitted himself to the faith. It is remarkable that no
one believed this of him; the reason thereof being that it
was impossible for him to be in earnest with the refutation
of what he asserted to be rational. That the refutation
was but weak and subjective does not justify anyone in
doubting Vanini’s sincerity; for poor reasons may be convincing
for the subject, just as the subject holds to his
own rights in respect of objective matters. What lies at
the bottom of the proceedings against Vanini is this, that
when a man by means of his reason has come to perceive
something which seems to him incontrovertible, he cannot
but adhere to these definite perceptions, he cannot believe
what is opposed to them. It is impossible to believe that
faith is stronger in him than this power of perception.</p>

<p>The Church in this way fell into the strange contradiction
of condemning Vanini, because he did not find her doctrines
in accordance with reason, and yet submitted himself to
them; she thus appeared to demand—a demand which she
emphasized with the burning pile—not that her doctrines
should be considered above reason, but in accordance with
it, and that reason should have merely the formal function of
explaining the content of theology, without adding anything
of her own. This susceptibility of the Church is inconsistent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and entangled her in contradictions. For in earlier times she
certainly admitted that reason could not grasp what was
revealed, and that it was consequently a matter of little
importance to refute and solve by reason the objections
which reason itself brought forward. But as she now
would not permit the contradiction of faith and reason to
be taken seriously, but burned Vanini at the stake as an
atheist for professing so to do, it was implied that the
doctrine of the Church cannot contradict reason, while man
has yet to submit reason to the Church.</p>

<p>There is kindled here the strife between so-called revelation
and reason, in which the latter emerges independently,
and the former is separated from it. Up to this time both
were one, or the light of man was the light of God; man
had not a light of his own, but his light was held to be
the divine. The Scholastics had no knowledge having a
content of its own beyond the content of religion; philosophy
remained entirely formal. But now it came to have
a content of its own, which was opposed to the content of
religion; or reason felt at least that it had its own content,
or was opposing the form of reasonableness to the immediate
content of the other.</p>

<p>This opposition had a different meaning in former times
from what it bears now-a-days; the earlier meaning
is this, that faith is the doctrine of Christianity, which
is given as truth, and by which as truth man has to
remain. We have here faith in this content, and opposed
to this stands conviction by means of reason. But now
this faith is transferred into the thinking consciousness
itself; it is a relation of self-consciousness itself to the facts
which it finds within itself, not to the objective content of
the doctrine. In respect to the earlier opposition a distinction
must be drawn in the objective creed; the one
part of it is the teaching of the Church as dogma, the
teaching as to the nature of God, that He is Three in One;
to this pertains the appearing of God in the world, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
flesh, the relation of man to this divine nature, His holiness
and divinity. That is the part which has to do with the
eternal verities, the part which is of absolute interest for
men; this part is in its content essentially speculative, and
can be object only for the speculative Notion. The other
part, belief in which is also required, has reference to other
external conceptions, which are connected with that content;
to this pertains the whole extent of what belongs to
history, in the Old and New Testament as well as in the
Church. A belief in all this finite element may be demanded
also. If a man, for instance, did not believe in
ghosts, he would be taken for a free-thinker, an atheist:
it would be just the same if a man did not believe that
Adam in Paradise ate of the forbidden fruit. Both parts
are placed upon the one level; but it tends to the destruction
of Church and faith, when belief is demanded for these
parts alike. It is to the external conceptions that attention
has been chiefly directed by those who have been
decried as opponents of Christianity and as atheists, down
to the time of Voltaire. When external conceptions such
as these are held to firmly, it is inevitable that contradictions
should be pointed out.</p>

<h3><a id="c143">5. <span class="smcap">Petrus Ramus.</span></a></h3>

<p>Pierre de la Ramée was born in 1515 in Vermandois,
where his father worked as a day-labourer. He early betook
himself to Paris, in order to satisfy his desire for
learning: he was, however, obliged on two occasions to
leave it on account of the difficulty he experienced in procuring
a subsistence, before he obtained employment as a
servant at the <i>Collége de Navarre</i>. Here he found an
opportunity of extending his knowledge; he occupied himself
with the Aristotelian philosophy and with mathematics,
and he distinguished himself in disputation by extraordinary
oratorical and dialectical readiness. In a disputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for obtaining the degree of <i>magister</i>, he came publicly
forward with a thesis that caused a great sensation: “All
that Aristotle taught is not true;” and the honour fell to
him. Having became <i>magister</i>, he attacked so bitterly and
violently the Aristotelian logic and dialectic, that the
government took notice of it. He was now accused of
undermining by his anti-Aristotelian opinions the foundations
of religion and science; this accusation was brought
before the parliament of Paris by the enemies of Ramus, as
a criminal case. But because the parliament appeared disposed
to act in a judicial way, and seemed favourably
inclined to Ramus, the complaint was withdrawn, and brought
before the council of the king. The latter decided that
Ramus should hold a disputation with his opponent Goveanus
before a special commission of five judges, two of whom
Goveanus was to choose, and two Ramus, while the king
was to appoint the president; these judges were to lay their
opinion of the result before the king. The interest of the
public was intense, but the contest was conducted in the
most pedantic way. On the first day Ramus maintained
that the Aristotelian logic and dialectic were imperfect and
faulty, because the <i>Organon</i> did not begin with a definition.
The commission decided that a disputation or a dissertation
requires indeed a definition, but in dialectic it is not necessary.
On the second day Ramus criticized the Aristotelian
logic for its want of arrangement; this, he asserted, is
essential. The majority of the judges, consisting of the
commissioner of the king and the two nominees of the
opponent Goveanus, now wished to annul the investigation
as far as it had gone, and to set to work in another way,
since the assertions of Ramus put them in a difficulty. He
appealed to the king, who, however, refused to hear him,
and decided that the decision of the judges should be considered
final. Ramus was hence condemned, but the other
two took no share in the matter, and, indeed, resigned. The
decision was publicly placarded in all the streets of Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and sent to all the academies of learning throughout Europe.
Plays aimed against Ramus were performed in the theatres,
greatly to the delight of the Aristotelians. The public
generally took a very lively interest in such disputes, and a
number of contests of this kind had already taken place on
similar questions of the schools. For example, the professors
in a royal <i>Collége</i> disputed with the theologians of the
Sorbonne whether <i>quidam</i>, <i>quisquis</i>, <i>quoniam</i> should be
said or <i>kidem</i>, <i>kiskis</i>, <i>koniam</i>, and from this dispute a case
before parliament arose, because the doctors took away his
benefice from a theologian who said <i>quisquis</i>. Another hot
and bitter controversy came before the magistrates as to
whether <i>ego amat</i> was as correct as <i>ego amo</i>, and this dispute
had to be suppressed by them. Finally Ramus obtained a
public educational appointment, a professorship in Paris;
but because he had become a Huguenot he had to vacate
this office several times in the internal disquietude that
prevailed; on one occasion he even went to travel in
Germany. On St. Bartholomew’s Eve in 1572, Ramus
finally fell, murdered through the instrumentality of his
enemies; one of his colleagues who was among his bitterest
enemies, Charpentier, had engaged assassins for the purpose,
by whom Ramus was frightfully maltreated, and then
thrown down from an upper window.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Ramus aroused great interest, more especially by his
attacks on the Aristotelian dialectic as it had hitherto existed,
and he contributed very greatly to the simplification
of the formal nature of the rules of dialectic. He is specially
famed for his extreme hostility to the scholastic logic, and
for having set up in opposition to it a logic of Ramus—an
opposition which has spread so far that even in the history
of literature in Germany we find various factions of Ramists
and anti-Ramists and semi-Ramists mentioned.</p>

<p>There are many other remarkable men who come within
this period and who are usually mentioned in the history of
Philosophy, such as Michael of Montaigne, Charron, Macchiavelli,
etc. The popular writings of the first two contain
pleasing, refined and spiritual thoughts on human life,
social relationships, the right and good. The efforts of
such men are counted as philosophy in as far as they have
drawn from their consciousness, from the sphere of human
experience, from observation, from what takes place in the
world and in the heart. It is in a philosophy of life that
they have comprehended and imparted such experiences;
they are thus both entertaining and instructive. In accordance
with the principle on which they worked, they
entirely forsook the sources from which Scholastic knowledge
had up to this time been derived, and also the
methods hitherto prevalent of acquiring it. But because
they do not make the question of highest interest to
Philosophy the object of their investigation, and do not
reason from thought, they do not properly belong to the history
of Philosophy, but to general culture and to the healthy
human understanding. They have contributed to man’s
taking a greater interest in his own affairs, to his obtaining
confidence in himself; and this is their main service. Man
has looked within his heart again and given to it its proper
value; then he has restored to his own heart and understanding,
to his faith, the essence of the relationship of the
individual to absolute existence. Although still a divided
heart, this division, this yearning, has become a disunion
within itself; and man feels this disunion within himself,
and along with that his rest in himself. But here we must
notice a transition, with which we are concerned, on account
of the universal principle which in it is known in a higher
way and in its true authority.</p>

<h2><a id="c146">C. <span class="smcap">The Reformation.</span></a></h2>

<p>It was in the Lutheran Reformation that the great revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
appeared, as, after the eternal conflicts and the
terrible discipline which the stiff-necked Germanic character
had undergone and which it had to undergo, mind came to
the consciousness of reconciliation with itself, a reconciliation
whose form required that it should be brought about
within the mind. From the Beyond man was thus called into
the presence of spirit, as earth and her bodily objects,
human virtues and morality, the individual heart and conscience,
began to have some value to him. In the church, if
marriage was not held to be immoral, self-restraint and
celibacy were considered higher, but now marriage came
to be looked on as a divine institution. Then poverty was
esteemed better than possession, and to live on alms was
considered higher than to support oneself honestly by the
work of one’s hands; now, however, it becomes known that
poverty is not the most moral life, for this last consists in
living by one’s work and taking pleasure in the fruits
thereof. The blind obedience by which human freedom
was suppressed, was the third vow taken by the monks, as
against which freedom, like marriage and property, was
now also recognized as divine. Similarly on the side of
knowledge man turned back into himself from the Beyond
of authority; and reason was recognized as the absolutely
universal, and hence as divine. Now it was perceived that
it is in the mind of man that religion must have its place, and
the whole process of salvation be gone through—that man’s
salvation is his own affair, and that by it he enters into relationship
with his conscience and into immediate connection
with God, requiring no mediation of priests having the so-called
means of grace within their hands. There is indeed
a mediation present still by means of doctrine, perception,
the observation of self and of one’s actions; but that is a
mediation without a separating wall, while formerly a brazen
wall of division was present separating the laity from the
church. It is thus the spirit of God that must dwell within the
heart of man, and this indwelling spirit must operate in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Wycliffe, Huss, and Arnold of Brescia had
started from scholastic philosophy with similar ends in view,
they did not possess the character requisite to enable them
modestly, and without any learned scholastic convictions,
to set aside everything but mind and spirit. It was with
Luther first of all that freedom of spirit began to exist in
embryo, and its form indicated that it would remain in
embryo. This beginning of the reconciliation of man with
himself, whereby divinity is brought into man’s actuality, is
thus, at first principle alone. The unfolding of this freedom
and the self-reflecting grasp of the same was a subsequent
step, in the same way as was the working out of the
Christian doctrine in the Church in its time. The subjective
thought and knowledge of man, which enables him, being
satisfied in his activity, to have joy in his work and to consider
his work as something both permissible and justifiable—this
value accorded to subjectivity now required a higher
confirmation, and the highest confirmation, in order to be
made perfectly legitimate, and even to become absolute
duty; and to be able to receive this confirmation it had to
be taken in its purest form. The mere subjectivity
of man, the fact that he has a will, and with it
directs his actions this way or that, does not constitute any
justification: for else the barbarous will, which fulfils itself
in subjective ends alone, such as cannot subsist before
reason, would be justified. If, further, self-will obtains the
form of universality, if its ends are conformable to reason,
and it is apprehended as the freedom of mankind, as legal
right which likewise belongs to others, there is therein only
indeed the element of permission, but still there is much
in the end being recognized as permitted, and not as
absolutely sinful. Art and industry receive through this
principle new activity, since now their activity is justified.
But we always find the principle of personal spirituality
and independence at first limited to particular spheres of
objects merely, in accordance with its content. Not until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
this principle is known and recognized in relation to the
absolutely existent object, <i>i.e.</i> in relation to God, and is
likewise grasped in its perfect purity, free from desires
and finite ends, does it receive its highest confirmation, and
that is its sanctification through religion.</p>

<p>This, then, is the Lutheran faith, in accordance with
which man stands in a relation to God which involves
his personal existence: that is, his piety and the hope
of his salvation and the like all demand that his heart,
his subjectivity, should be present in them. His feelings,
his faith, the inmost certainty of himself, in short, all
that belongs to him is laid claim to, and this alone
can truly come under consideration: man must himself
repent from his heart and experience contrition; his own
heart must be filled with the Holy Ghost. Thus here the
principle of subjectivity, of pure relation to me personally,
<i>i.e.</i> freedom, is recognized, and not merely so, but it
is clearly demanded that in religious worship this alone
should be considered. The highest confirmation of the
principle is that it alone has value in the eyes of God, that
faith and the subjection of the individual heart are alone
essential: in this way this principle of Christian freedom
is first presented and brought to a true consciousness.
Thereby a place has been set apart in the depths of man’s
inmost nature, in which alone he is at home with himself
and at home with God; and with God alone is he really
himself, in the conscience he can be said to be at home with
himself. This sense of being at home should not be
capable of being destroyed through others; no one should
presume to have a place therein. All externality in relation
to me is thereby banished, just as is the externality of the
Host; it is only in communion and faith that I stand in
relation to God. The distinction between the laity and the
priests is by it removed; there are no longer any laymen,
for in religion each by himself is enjoined to know personally
what it is. Responsibility is not to be avoided; good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
works without spiritual reality in them are no longer of
avail; there must be the heart which relates itself directly
to God without mediation, without the Virgin, and without
the Saints.</p>

<p>This is the great principle—that all externality disappears
in the point of the absolute relation to God;
along with this externality, this estrangement of self, all
servitude has also disappeared. With it is connected our
ceasing to tolerate prayer in foreign tongues, or to study
the sciences in such. In speech man is productive; it is
the first externality that he gives himself, the simplest
form of existence which he reaches in consciousness.
What man represents to himself, he inwardly places before
himself as spoken. This first form is broken up and
rendered foreign if man is in an alien tongue to express
or conceive to himself what concerns his highest
interest. This breach with the first entrance into consciousness
is accordingly removed; to have one’s own
right to speak and think in one’s own language really
belongs to liberty. This is of infinite importance, and
without this form of being-at-home-with-self subjective
freedom could not have existed; Luther could not have
accomplished his Reformation without translating the Bible
into German. Now the principle of subjectivity has thus
become a moment in religion itself, and in this way
it has received its absolute recognition, and has been
grasped as a whole in the form in which it can only be
a moment in religion. The injunction to worship God in
spirit is now fulfilled. Spirit, however, is merely conditioned
by the free spirituality of the subject. For it is
this alone which can be related to spirit; a subject who is
not free does not stand in an attitude of spirituality, does
not worship God in spirit. This is the general signification
of the principle.</p>

<p>Now this principle was at first grasped in relation to
religious objects only, and thereby it has indeed received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
its absolute justification, but still it has not been extended
to the further development of the subjective principle itself.
Yet in so far as man has come to the consciousness of being
reconciled to himself, and of only being able to reconcile
himself in his personal existence, he has in his actuality
likewise attained another form. The otherwise hearty and
vigorous man may also, in as far as he enjoys, do so with
a good conscience; the enjoyment of life for its own sake
is no longer regarded as something which is to be given
up, for monkish renunciation is renounced. But to any
other content the principle did not at first extend. Yet
further, the religious content has more specially been apprehended
as concrete, as it is for the recollection, and into this
spiritual freedom the beginning and the possibility of an
unspiritual mode of regarding things has thus entered.
The content of the <i>Credo</i>, speculative as it is in itself, has,
that is to say, an historical side. Within this barren form
the old faith of the church has been admitted and allowed
to exist, so that in this form it has to be regarded by the
subject as the highest truth. The result then follows that
all development of the dogmatic content in a speculative
manner is quite set aside. What was required is man’s
inward assurance of his deliverance, of his salvation—the
relation of the subjective spirit to the absolute, the form
of subjectivity as aspiration, repentance, conversion.
This new principle has been laid down as paramount,
so that the content of truth is clearly of importance; but
the teaching respecting the nature and the process of God is
grasped in the form in which it at first appears for the
ordinary conception. Not only have all this finality, externality,
unspirituality, this formalism of scholastic philosophy,
been on the one hand discarded, and with justice, but, on
the other, the philosophic development of the doctrines
of the church has been also set aside, and this is done in
connection with the very fact that the subject is immersed
in his own heart. This immersion, his penitence, contrition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
conversion, this occupation of the subject with himself,
has become the moment of first importance; but the
subject has not immersed himself in the content, and the
earlier immersion of spirit therein has also been rejected.
Even to this present day we shall find in the Catholic Church
and in her dogmas the echoes, and so to speak the heritage
of the philosophy of the Alexandrian school; in it there is
much more that is philosophic and speculative than in the
dogmatism of Protestantism, even if there is still in this an
objective element, and if it has not been made perfectly
barren, as though the content were really retained only in
the form of history. The connection of Philosophy with
the theology of the Middle Ages has thus in the Catholic
Church been retained in its essentials; in Protestantism,
on the contrary, the subjective religious principle has been
separated from Philosophy, and it is only in Philosophy
that it has arisen in its true form again. In this principle
the religious content of the Christian Church is thus retained,
and it obtains its confirmation through the testimony
of spirit that this content shall only hold good for
me in as far as it makes its influence felt in my conscience
and heart. This is the meaning of the words: “If any
man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether
it be of God.” The criterion of truth is how it is confirmed
in my heart; the fact that I judge and know rightly—or
that what I hold to be true is the truth—must be revealed
to my heart. Truth is what it is in <i>my</i> mind; and, on the
other hand, my spirit is only then in its proper attitude to
truth when truth is within it, when the spirit and its content
are related thus. One cannot be isolated from the other.
The content has not thus the confirmation in itself which
was given to it by philosophical theology in the fact that
the speculative Idea made itself therein effectual; neither
has it the historic confirmation which is given to a content
in so far as it has an outward and historic side in which
historic witnesses are heard in evidence, and in which its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
correctness is determined by their testimony. The doctrine
has to prove itself by the condition of my heart, by penitence,
conversion and joy in God. In doctrine we begin with the
external content, and thus it is external only; but taken
thus, independently of the state of my mind, it properly
speaking has no significance. Now this beginning is, as
Christian baptism and education, a working upon the nature
in addition to an acquaintance with externals. The truth
of the gospel and of Christian doctrines only, however,
exists in true relation to the same; it is really so to speak
a use of the content to make it educative. And this is
just what has been said, that the nature is reconstructed
and sanctified in itself, and it is this sanctification for which
the content is a true one. No further use can be made of
the content than to build up and edify the mind, and
awaken it to assurance, joy, penitence, conversion.
Another and wrong relation to the content is to take it in
an external way, <i>e.g.</i> according to the great new principle
of exegesis, and to treat the writings of the New Testament
like those of a Greek, Latin or other author, critically,
philologically, historically. Spirit is alone in true relation
to spirit; and it is a wrong beginning of a wooden
and unyielding exegesis to prove in such an external and
philological way the truth of the Christian religion. This
has been done by orthodoxy, which thereby renders the
content devoid of spirituality. This, then, is the first
relation of spirit to this content; here the content is
indeed essential, but it is as essential that the holy and
sanctifying spirit should bear a relation to it.</p>

<p>This spirit is, however, in the second place really thinking
spirit likewise. Thought as such must also develop
itself therein, and that really as this form of inmost unity
of spirit with itself; thought must come to the distinction
and contemplation of this content, and pass over into this
form of the purest unity of spirit with itself. At first
thought, however, reveals itself as abstract thought alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and it possesses as such a relation to theology and religion.
The content which is here in question, even in so far as it
is historic merely and externally accepted, must yet be
religious; the unfolding of the nature of God must be
present therein. In this we have the further demand that
the thought for which the inward nature of God is, should
also set itself in relation to this content. But inasmuch
as thought is at first understanding and the metaphysic of
the understanding, it will remove from the content the
rational Idea and make it so empty that only external
history remains, which is devoid of interest.</p>

<p>The third position arrived at is that of concrete
speculative thought. According to the standpoint which has
just been given, and as religious feeling and its form are here
determined, all speculative content as such, as well as its developments,
are at first rejected. And as for the enrichment
of the Christian conceptions through the treasures of the
philosophy of the ancient world, and through the profound
ideas of all earlier oriental religions, and the like,—all this
is set aside. The content had objectivity; but this merely
signified that the objective content, without subsisting for
itself, was to constitute the beginning only, on which the
mind had spiritually to build up and sanctify itself. All
the enrichment of the content whereby it became philosophic,
is thus abandoned, and what follows later simply is that
the mind, as thinking, again immerses itself in itself, in
order to be concrete and rational. What forms the basis
of the Reformation is the abstract moment of a mind
being within self, of freedom, of coming to self; freedom
signifies the life of the spirit in being turned back within
itself in the particular content which appears as another;
while spirit is not free if it allows this other-being, either
unassimilated or dead, to exist in it as something foreign.
In as far as spirit now goes on to knowledge, to spiritual
determinations, and as it looks around and comes forth as a
content, so far will it conduct itself therein as in its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
domain, as in its concrete world, so to speak—and it will
there really assert and possess its own. This concrete form
of knowledge which, however, in the beginning remains
but dim, we have now to consider, and it forms the third
period of our treatise, into which we properly step with the
Reformation, although Bruno, Vanini and Ramus, who lived
later, still belong to the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class="pc4 mid">PART THREE</p>

<p class="pc1 large">MODERN PHILOSOPHY</p>

<h2 class="p2" id="c157">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">If</span> we cast a glance back over the period just traversed,
we find that in it a turning-point had been reached, that
the Christian religion had placed its absolute content in the
mind and will of man, and that it was thus, as a divine and
supersensuous content, separated from the world and shut
up within itself in the centre-point of the individual. Over
against the religious life an external world stood as a
natural world—a world of heart or feeling, of desire, of
human nature—which had value only in as far as it was overcome.
This mutual independence of the two worlds had
much attention bestowed on it throughout the Middle Ages;
the opposition was attacked on all quarters and in the end
overcome. But since the relation of mankind to the divine
life exists upon earth, this conquest at first presented the
appearance of bringing with it the destruction of the
church and of the eternal through the sensuous desires of
man. The eternal truth was likewise grafted upon the
dry, formal understanding, so that we might say that the
separation of self-consciousness has in itself disappeared,
and thereby a possibility has been given of obtaining reconciliation.
But because this implicit union of the Beyond
and the Here was of so unsatisfactory a nature that the
better feelings were aroused and forced to turn against it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the Reformation made its appearance, partly, no doubt, as a
separation from the Catholic Church, but partly as a reformation
from within. There is a mistaken idea that the Reformation
only effected a separation from the Catholic Church;
Luther just as truly reformed the Catholic Church, the corruption
of which one learns from his writings, and from the
reports of the emperors and of the empire to the Pope; if
further evidence be required, we need only read the
accounts given even by the Catholic bishops, the Fathers of
the councils at Constance, Basle, &amp;c., of the condition of
the Catholic priesthood and of the Roman Court. The
principle of the inward reconciliation of spirit, which was in
itself the very Idea of Christianity, was thus again estranged,
and appeared as a condition of external, unreconciled alienation
and discord; this gives us an example of the slow
operation of the world-spirit in overcoming this externality.
It eats away the inward substance, but the appearance, the
outward form, still remains; at the end, however, it is an
empty shell, the new form breaks forth. In such times this
spirit appears as if it—having so far proceeded in its
development at a snail’s pace, and having even retrograded
and become estranged from itself—had suddenly adopted
seven-leagued boots.</p>

<p>Since thus the reconciliation of self-consciousness with
the present is implicitly accomplished, man has attained to
confidence in himself and in his thought, in sensuous nature
outside of and within him; he has discovered an interest
and pleasure in making discoveries both in nature and the
arts. In the affairs of this world the understanding
developed; man became conscious of his will and his
achievements, took pleasure in the earth and its soil, as also
in his occupations, because right and understanding were
there present. With the discovery of gunpowder the individual
passion of battle was lost. The romantic impulse
towards a casual kind of bravery passed into other adventures,
not of hate or revenge, or the so-called deliverance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from what men considered the wrongs of innocence, but
more harmless adventures, the exploration of the earth, or
the discovery of the passage to the East Indies. America
was discovered, its treasures and people—nature, man himself;
navigation was the higher romance of commerce.
The present world was again present to man as worthy of
the interests of mind; thinking mind was again capable
of action. Now the Reformation of Luther had inevitably
to come—the appeal to the <i>sensus communis</i> which does not
recognize the authority of the Fathers or of Aristotle, but
only the inward personal spirit which quickens and animates,
in contradistinction to works. In this way the Church
lost her power against it, for her principle was within it
and no longer lacking to it. To the finite and present due
honour is accorded; from this honour the work of science
proceeds. We thus see that the finite, the inward and outward
present, becomes a matter of experience, and through
the understanding is elevated into universality; men desire
to understand laws and forces, <i>i.e.</i> to transform the individual
of perceptions into the form of universality. Worldly
matters demand to be judged of in a worldly way; the
judge is thinking understanding. The other side is that the
eternal, which is in and for itself true, is also known and
comprehended through the pure heart itself; the individual
mind appropriates to itself the eternal. This is the
Lutheran faith without any other accessories—works, as
they were called. Everything had value only as it was
grasped by the heart, and not as a mere thing. The content
ceases to be an objective thing; God is thus in spirit
alone, He is not a beyond but the truest reality of the
individual.</p>

<p>Pure thought is likewise one form of inwardness; it also
approaches absolute existence and finds itself justified in
apprehending the same. The philosophy of modern times
proceeds from the principle which ancient philosophy had
reached, the standpoint of actual self-consciousness—it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
as principle the spirit that is present to itself; it brings the
standpoint of the Middle Ages, the diversity between what
is thought and the existent universe, into opposition, and it
has to do with the dissolution of this same opposition. The
main interest hence is, not so much the thinking of the
objects in their truth, as the thinking and understanding of
the objects, the thinking this unity itself, which is really the
being conscious of a presupposed object. The getting rid
of the formal culture of the logical understanding and the
monstrosities of which it was composed, was more essential
than the extension of it: investigation in such a case becomes
dissipated and diffused, and passes into the false infinite.
The general points of view which in modern philosophy we
reach are hence somewhat as follows:—</p>

<p>1. The concrete form of thought which we have here to
consider on its own account, really appears as subjective
with the reflection of implicitude, so that this has an
antithesis in existence; and the interest is then altogether
found in grasping the reconciliation of this opposition in
its highest existence, <i>i.e.</i> in the most abstract extremes.
This highest severance is the opposition between thought
and Being, the comprehending of whose unity from this
time forward constitutes the interest of all philosophies.
Here thought is more independent, and thus we now
abandon its unity with theology; it separates itself therefrom,
just as with the Greeks it separated itself from
mythology, the popular religion, and did not until the time
of the Alexandrians seek out these forms again and fill
the mythological conceptions with the form of thought.
The bond remains, but for this reason it is clearly implicit:
theology throughout is merely what philosophy is, for this
last is simply thought respecting it. It does not help
theology to strive against philosophy, or to say that it wishes
to know nothing about it, and that philosophic maxims
are thus to be set aside. It has always to do with the
thought that it brings along with it, and these its subjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
conceptions, its home and private metaphysics, are thus
frequently a quite uncultured, uncritical thought—the
thought of the street. These general conceptions are, indeed,
connected with particular subjective conviction, and this last
is said to prove the Christian content to be true in a sense
all its own; but these thoughts which constitute the criterion
are merely the reflections and opinions which float about
the surface of the time. Thus, when thought comes forth
on its own account, we thereby separate ourselves from
theology; we shall, however, consider one other in whom
both are still in unity. This individual is Jacob Boehme,
for since mind now moves in its own domains, it is found
partly in the natural and finite world, and partly in the
inward, and this at first is the Christian.</p>

<p>While earlier than this, moreover, the spirit, distracted
by outward things, had to make its influence felt in
religion and in the secular life, and came to be known
in the popular philosophy so-called, it was only in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries that the genuine Philosophy
re-appeared, which seeks to grasp the truth as truth
because man in thought is infinitely free to comprehend
himself and nature, and along with that seeks to understand
the present of rationality, reality, universal law
itself. For this is ours, since it is subjectivity. The
principle of modern philosophy is hence not a free and
natural thought, because it has the opposition of thought
and nature before it as a fact of which it is conscious.
Spirit and nature, thought and Being, are the two infinite
sides of the Idea, which can for the first time truly make its
appearance when its sides are grasped for themselves in
their abstraction and totality. Plato comprehended it as the
bond, as limiting and as infinite, as one and many, simple
and diverse, but not as thought and Being; when we first
thinkingly overcome this opposition it signifies comprehending
the unity. This is the standpoint of philosophic
consciousness generally; but the way in which this unity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
must be thinkingly developed is a double one. Philosophy
hence falls into the two main forms in which the opposition
is resolved, into a realistic and an idealistic system of
philosophy, <i>i.e.</i> into one which makes objectivity and
the content of thought to arise from the perceptions,
and one which proceeds to truth from the independence
of thought.</p>

<p>a. Experience constitutes the first of these methods, viz.
Realism. Philosophy now signified, or had as its main
attribute, self-thought and the acceptance of the present as
that in which truth lay, and which was thereby knowable.
All that is speculative is pared and smoothed down in order
to bring it under experience. This present is the existent
external nature, and spiritual activity as the political world
and as subjective activity. The way to truth was to begin
from this hypothesis, but not to remain with it in its
external self-isolating actuality, but to lead it to the
universal.</p>

<p>α. The activities of that first method operate, to begin
with, on physical nature, from the observation of which
men derive universal laws, and on this basis their knowledge
is founded; the science of nature, however, only
reaches to the stage of reflection. This kind of experimental
physics was once called, and is still called philosophy,
as Newton’s <i>Principia philosophiæ naturalis</i> (Vol. I. p. 59)
show. This work is one in which the methods of the finite
sciences through observation and deduction are alone
present—those sciences which the French still call the
<i>sciences exactes</i>. To this, the understanding of the individual,
piety was opposed, and hence in this respect philosophy
was termed worldly wisdom (Vol. I. p. 60). Here the
Idea in its infinitude is not itself the object of knowledge;
but a determinate content is raised into the universal, or this
last in its determinateness for the understanding is derived
from observation, just as is, for instance, done in Keppler’s
Laws. In Scholastic philosophy, on the other hand, man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
power of observation was set aside, and disputations respecting
nature at that time proceeded from abstruse
hypotheses.</p>

<p>β. In the second place, the spiritual was observed as in
its realization it constitutes the spiritual world of states, in
order thus to investigate from experience the rights of
individuals as regards one another, and as regards rulers,
and the rights of states against states. Before this popes
anointed kings, just as was done in Old Testament times
to those appointed by God; it was in the Old Testament
that the tithe was commanded; the forbidden degrees
of relationship in marriage were also adopted from the
Mosaic laws. What was right and permissible for kings
was demonstrated from Saul’s and David’s histories, the
rights of priesthood from Samuel—in short, the Old Testament
was the source of all the principles of public law, and
it is in this way even now that all papal bulls have their
deliverances confirmed. It may easily be conceived how
much nonsense was in this manner concocted. Now,
however, right was sought for in man himself, and in
history, and what had been accounted right both in peace
and in war was explained. In this way books were
composed which even now are constantly quoted in the
Parliament of England. Men further observed the desires
which could be satisfied in the state and the manner in
which satisfaction could be given to them, in order thus
from man himself, from man of the past as well as of the
present, to learn what is right.</p>

<p>b. The second method, that of Idealism, proceeds from
what is inward; according to it everything is in thought,
mind itself is all content. Here the Idea itself is made the
object; that signifies the thinking it and from it proceeding
to the determinate. What Realism draws from experience
is now derived from thought <i>à priori</i>; or the determinate
is also comprehended but not led back to the universal
merely, but to the Idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The two methods overlap one another, however, because
experience on its side desires to derive universal laws from
observations, while, on the other side, thought proceeding
from abstract universality must still give itself a determinate
content; thus <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i> methods are
mingled. In France abstract universality was the more
predominant; from England experience took its rise, and
even now it is there held in the greatest respect; Germany
proceeded from the concrete Idea, from the inwardness of
mind and spirit.</p>

<p>2. The questions of present philosophy, the opposites,
the content which occupies the attention of these modern
times, are as follows:—</p>

<p>a. The first form of the opposition which we have already
touched upon in the Middle Ages is the Idea of God and
His Being, and the task imposed is to deduce the existence
of God, as pure spirit, from thought. Both sides must
be comprehended through thought as absolute unity; the
extremest opposition is apprehended as gathered into
one unity. Other subjects which engage our attention
are connected with the same general aim, namely, the
bringing about of the inward reconciliation in the opposition
which exists between knowledge and its object.</p>

<p>b. The second form of opposition is that of Good and Evil—the
opposition of the assertion of independent will to the
positive and universal; the origin of evil must be known.
Evil is plainly the “other,” the negation of God as Holiness;
because He is, because He is wise, good, and at the
same time almighty, evil is contradictory to Him; an
endeavour is made to reconcile this contradiction.</p>

<p>c. The third form of opposition is that of the freedom of
man and necessity.</p>

<p>α. The individual is clearly not determined in any other
way than from himself, he is the absolute beginning of determination;
in the ‘I,’ in the self, a power of decision is
clearly to be found. This freedom is in opposition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
theory that God alone is really absolutely determining.
Further, when that which happens is in futurity, the determining
of it through God is regarded as Providence and the
fore-knowledge of God. In this, however, a new contradiction
is involved, inasmuch as because God’s knowledge is not
merely subjective, that which God knows likewise is.</p>

<p>β. Further still, human freedom is in opposition to necessity
as the determinateness of nature; man is dependent on
nature, and the external as well as the inward nature of
man is his necessity as against his freedom.</p>

<p>γ. Considered objectively, this opposition is that between
final causes and efficient causes, <i>i.e.</i> between the acts of freedom
and the acts of necessity.</p>

<p>δ. This opposition between the freedom of man and
natural necessity has finally likewise the further form of
community of soul and body, of <i>commercium animi cum
corpore</i>, as it has been called, wherein the soul appears as
the simple, ideal, and free, and the body as the manifold,
material and necessary.</p>

<p>These matters occupy the attention of science, and they
are of a completely different nature from the interests of
ancient philosophy. The difference is this, that here there
is a consciousness of an opposition, which is certainly likewise
contained in the subjects with which the learning of
the ancients was occupied, but which had not come to consciousness.
This consciousness of the opposition, this ‘Fall,’
is the main point of interest in the conception of the Christian
religion. The bringing about in thought of the reconciliation
which is accepted in belief, now constitutes the
whole interest of knowledge. Implicitly it has come to pass;
for knowledge considers itself qualified to bring about in
itself this recognition of the reconciliation. The philosophic
systems are therefore no more than modes of this
absolute unity, and only the concrete unity of those opposites
is the truth.</p>

<p>3. As regards the stages which were reached in the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of this knowledge we have to mention three of the
principal.</p>

<p>a. First of all we find the union of those opposites stated;
and to prove it genuine attempts are made, though not yet
determined in purity.</p>

<p>b. The second stage is the metaphysical union; and here,
with Descartes, the philosophy of modern times as abstract
thought properly speaking begins.</p>

<p>α. Thinking understanding seeks to bring to pass the
union, inasmuch as it investigates with its pure thought-determinations;
this is in the first place the standpoint of
metaphysics as such.</p>

<p>β. In the second place, we have to consider negation, the
destruction of this metaphysics—the attempt to consider
knowledge on its own account, and the determinations which
proceed from it.</p>

<p>c. The third stage is that this union itself which is to be
brought about, and which is the only subject of interest,
comes to consciousness and becomes an object. As principle
the union has the form of the relationship of knowledge to the
content, and thus this question has been put: ‘How is, and
how can thought be identical with the objective?’ With
this the inward element which lies at the basis of this metaphysic
is raised into explicitude and made an object; and
this includes all modern philosophy in its range.</p>

<p>4. In respect to the external history and the lives of the
philosophers, it will strike us that from this time on, these
appear to be very different from those of the philosophers
of ancient times, whom we regarded as self-sufficing individualities.
It is required that a philosopher should live as he
teaches, that he should despise the world and not enter into
connection with it; this the ancients have accomplished, and
they are such plastic individualities just because the inward
spiritual aim of philosophy has likewise frequently determined
their external relations and conditions. The object
of their knowledge was to take a thoughtful view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the universe; they kept the external connection with
the world all the further removed from themselves because
they did not greatly approve of much therein present; or,
at least, it ever proceeds on its way, according to its own
particular laws, on which the individual is dependent. The
individual likewise participates in the present interests of
external life, in order to satisfy his personal ends, and
through them to attain to honour, wealth, respect, and distinction;
the ancient philosophers, however, because they
remained in the Idea, did not concern themselves with things
that were not the objects of their thought. Hence with the
Greeks and Romans the philosophers lived in an independent
fashion peculiar to themselves, and in an external
mode of life which appeared suitable to and worthy of the
science they professed; they conducted themselves independently
as private persons, unfettered by outside trammels,
and they may be compared to the monks who renounced
all temporal goods.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages it was chiefly the clergy, doctors of
theology, who occupied themselves with philosophy. In
the transition period the philosophers showed themselves
to be in an inward warfare with themselves and in an
external warfare with their surroundings, and their lives
were spent in a wild, unsettled fashion.</p>

<p>In modern times things are very different; now we no
longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class
by themselves. With the present day all difference has
disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find
them generally in connection with the world, participating
with others in some common work or calling. They
live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or
they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the
state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so,
their position as such does not in any way isolate them
from their other relationships. They are involved in
present conditions, in the world and its work and progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of
luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be
found in the manner in which outward conditions have
taken shape after the building up of the inward world of
religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the
reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the
external world is at rest, is brought into order—worldly
relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become
constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable
to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible
connection, and with that individuality likewise
attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the
plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of
such power that every individuality is under its dominion,
and yet at the same time can construct for itself an
inward world. The external has thus been reconciled with
itself in such a way that both inward and outward may be
self-sufficing and remain independent of one another; and
the individual is in the condition of being able to leave his
external side to external order, while in the case of those
plastic forms the external could only be determined entirely
from within. Now, on the contrary, with the higher
degree of strength attained by the inward side of the
individual, he may hand the external over to chance; just
as he leaves clothing to the contingencies of fashion,
not considering it worth while to exert his understanding
upon it. The external he leaves to be determined by
the order which is present in the particular sphere in which
his lot is cast. The circumstances of life are, in the true
sense, private affairs, determined by outward conditions,
and do not contain anything worthy of our notice. Life
becomes scholarly, uniform, commonplace, it connects itself
with outwardly given relationships and cannot represent or
set itself forth as a form pertaining only to itself. Man
must not take up the character of showing himself an
independent form, and giving himself a position in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
world created by himself. Because the objective power of
external relationships is infinitely great, and for that reason
the way in which I perforce am placed in them has
become a matter of indifference to me, personality and
the individual life generally are equally indifferent. A
philosopher, it is said, should live as a philosopher, <i>i.e.</i>,
should be independent of the external relationships of the
world, and should give up occupying himself with and
troubling himself concerning them. But thus circumscribed
in respect of all necessities, more especially of
culture, no one can suffice for himself; he must seek to
act in connection with others. The modern world is this
essential power of connection, and it implies the fact that
it is clearly necessary for the individual to enter into these
relations of external existence; only a common mode of
existence is possible in any calling or condition, and to this
Spinoza forms the solitary exception. Thus in earlier
times bravery was individual; while modern bravery
consists in each not acting after his own fashion, but
relying on his connection with others—and this constitutes
his whole merit. The calling of philosopher is not, like
that of the monks, an organized condition. Members of
academies of learning are no doubt organized in part, but
even a special calling like theirs sinks into the ordinary
commonplace of state or class relationships, because admission
thereinto is outwardly determined. The real matter
is to remain faithful to one’s aims.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge" id="c170a">SECTION ONE</p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">Modern Philosophy in its First Statement</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> first two philosophers whom we have to consider are
Bacon and Boehme; there is as complete a disparity between
these individuals as between their systems of philosophy.
None the less both agree that mind operates in the
content of its knowledge as in its own domain, and this
consequently appears as concrete Being. This domain in
Bacon is the finite, natural world; in Boehme it is the
inward, mystical, godly Christian life and existence; for
the former starts from experience and induction, the latter
from God and the pantheism of the Trinity.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c170b">A. <span class="smcap">Bacon.</span></a></h2>

<p>There was already being accomplished the abandonment
of the content which lies beyond us, and which through its
form has lost the merit it possessed of being true, and is become
of no significance to self-consciousness or the certainty
of self and of its actuality; this we see for the first time
consciously expressed, though not as yet in a very perfect
form, by Francis Bacon, Baron Verulam, Viscount St.
Albans. He is therefore instanced as in the fore-front of
all this empirical philosophy, and even now our countrymen
like to adorn their works with sententious sayings culled
from him. Baconian philosophy thus usually means a
philosophy which is founded on the observation of the
external or spiritual nature of man in his inclinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
desires, rational and judicial qualities. From these conclusions
are drawn, and general conceptions, laws pertaining
to this domain, are thus discovered. Bacon has
entirely set aside and rejected the scholastic method of
reasoning from remote abstractions and being blind to
what lies before one’s eyes. He takes as his standpoint
the sensuous manifestation as it appears to the cultured
man, as the latter reflects upon it; and this is conformable
to the principle of accepting the finite and worldly as
such.</p>

<p>Bacon was born in London in 1561. His progenitors
and relatives held high office in the state, and his father
was Keeper of the Great Seal to Queen Elizabeth. He in
his turn, having been educated to follow the same vocation,
at once devoted himself to the business of the state, and
entered upon an important career. He early displayed
great talent, and at the age of nineteen he produced a work
on the condition of Europe (<i>De statu Europæ</i>). Bacon in
his youth attached himself to the Earl of Essex, the
favourite of Elizabeth, through whose support he, who as
a younger son had to see his paternal estate pass to his
elder brother, soon attained to better circumstances, and
was elevated to a higher position. Bacon, however, sullied
his fame by the utmost ingratitude and faithlessness towards
his protector; for he is accused of having been
prevailed upon by the enemies of the Earl after his fall to
charge him publicly with High Treason. Under James I.,
the father of Charles I. who was beheaded, a weak man,
to whom he recommended himself by his work <i>De augmentis
scientiarum</i>, he received the most honourable offices
of state by attaching himself to Buckingham: he was made
Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord Chancellor of England,
Baron Verulam. He likewise made a rich marriage,
though he soon squandered all his means, and high though
his position was, he stooped to intrigues and was guilty of
accepting bribes in the most barefaced manner. Thereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
he brought upon himself the ill-will both of people and of
nobles, so that he was prosecuted, and his case was tried
before Parliament. He was fined 40,000<i>l.</i>, thrown into
the Tower, and his name was struck out of the list of peers;
during the trial and while he was in prison he showed the
greatest weakness of character. He was, however, liberated
from prison, and his trial was annulled, owing to the even
greater hatred of the king and his minister Buckingham,
under whose administration Bacon had filled these offices,
and whose victim he appeared to have been; for he fell
earlier than his comrade Buckingham, and was deserted
and condemned by him. It was not so much his innocence
as the fact that those who ruined him had made
themselves hated to an equal degree through their rule, that
caused the hatred and indignation against Bacon to be
somewhat mitigated. But he neither recovered his own
sense of self-respect nor the personal esteem of others,
which he had lost through his former conduct. He retired
into private life, lived in poverty, had to beg sustenance
from the king, occupied himself during the remainder of
his life with science only, and died in 1626.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>Since Bacon has ever been esteemed as the man who
directed knowledge to its true source, to experience, he is,
in fact, the special leader and representative of what is in
England called Philosophy, and beyond which the English
have not yet advanced. For they appear to constitute that
people in Europe which, limited to the understanding of
actuality, is destined, like the class of shopkeepers and
workmen in the State, to live always immersed in matter,
and to have actuality but not reason as object. Bacon
won great praise by showing how attention is to be paid to
the outward and inward manifestations of Nature, and the
esteem in which his name is thus held is greater than can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
be ascribed directly to his merit. It has become the
universal tendency of the time and of the English mode of
reasoning, to proceed from facts, and to judge in accordance
with them. Because Bacon gave expression to the tendency,
and men require to have a leader and originator for
any particular manner of thinking, he is credited with
having given to knowledge this impulse towards experimental
philosophy generally. But many cultured men have
spoken and thought regarding what concerns and interests
mankind, regarding state affairs, mind, heart, external
nature, &amp;c., in accordance with experience and in accordance
with a cultured knowledge of the world. Bacon was
just such a cultured man of the world, who had seen life
in its great relations, had engaged in state affairs, had
dealt practically with actual life, had observed men, their
circumstances and relations, and had worked with them as
cultured, reflecting, and, we may even say, philosophical
men of the world. He thus did not escape the corruption
of those who stood at the helm of the state. With all the
depravity of his character he was a man of mind and clear
perception; he did not, however, possess the power of
reasoning through thoughts and notions that are universal.
We do not find in him a methodical or scientific manner of
regarding things, but only the external reasoning of a man
of the world. Knowledge of the world he possessed in the
highest degree: “rich imagination, powerful wit, and the
penetrating wisdom which he displays upon that most
interesting of all subjects, commonly called the world.
This last appears to us to have been the characteristical
quality of Bacon’s genius.... It was men rather than
things that he had studied, the mistakes of philosophers
rather than the errors of philosophy. In fact he was no
lover of abstract reasoning,” and although it pertains to
philosophy, we find as little as possible of it in him. “His
writings are indeed full of refined and most acute observations,
but it seldom requires any effort on our part to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
apprehend their wisdom.” Hence mottoes are often
derived from him. “His judgments,” however, “are
commonly given <i>ex cathedra</i>, or, if he endeavours to elucidate
them, it is by similes and illustrations and pointed
animadversions more than by direct and appropriate arguments.
General reasoning is absolutely essential in philosophy;
the want of it is marked in Bacon’s writings.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
His practical writings are specially interesting; but we do
not find the bright flashes of genius that we expected. As
during his career in the state he acted in accordance with
practical utility, he now, at its conclusion, likewise applied
himself in a practical way to scientific endeavours, and
considered and treated the sciences in accordance with
concrete experience and investigation. His is a consideration
of the present, he makes the most of, and ascribes
value to it as it appears; the existent is thus regarded with
open eyes, respect is paid to it as to what reigns pre-eminent,
and this sensuous perception is reverenced and
recognized. Here a confidence on the part of reason in
itself and in nature is awakened; it thinkingly applies
itself to nature, certain of finding the truth in it, since both
are in themselves harmonious.</p>

<p>Bacon likewise treated the sciences methodically; he did
not merely bring forward opinions and sentiments, he did
not merely express himself regarding the sciences dogmatically,
as a fine gentleman might, but he went into the
matter closely, and established a method in respect of
scientific knowledge. It is only through this method of
investigation introduced by him that he is noteworthy—it
is in that way alone that he can be considered to belong
to the history of the sciences and of philosophy. And
through this principle of methodical knowledge he has
likewise produced a great effect upon his times, by drawing
attention to what was lacking in the sciences, both in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
methods and in their content. He set forth the general
principles of procedure in an empirical philosophy. The
spirit of the philosophy of Bacon is to take experience as
the true and only source of knowledge, and then to regulate
the thought concerning it. Knowledge from experience
stands in opposition to knowledge arising from the speculative
Notion, and the opposition is apprehended in so acute
a manner that the knowledge proceeding from the Notion
is ashamed of the knowledge from experience, just as this
again takes up a position of antagonism to the knowledge
through the Notion. What Cicero says of Socrates may be
said of Bacon, that he brought Philosophy down to the
world, to the homes and every-day lives of men (Vol. I.
p. 389). To a certain extent knowledge from the absolute
Notion may assume an air of superiority over this knowledge;
but it is essential, as far as the Idea is concerned,
that the particularity of the content should be developed.
The Notion is an essential matter, but as such its finite side
is just as essential. Mind gives presence, external existence,
to itself; to come to understand this extension, the world as
it is, the sensuous universe, to understand itself as this, <i>i.e.</i>
with its manifest, sensuous extension, is one side of things.
The other side is the relation to the Idea. Abstraction in
and for itself must determine and particularize itself. The
Idea is concrete, self-determining, it has the principle of
development; and perfect knowledge is always developed.
A conditional knowledge in respect of the Idea merely
signifies that the working out of the development has
not yet advanced very far. But we have to deal with
this development; and for this development and determination
of the particular from the Idea, so that the knowledge
of the universe, of nature, may be cultivated—for this, the
knowledge of the particular is necessary. This particularity
must be worked out on its own account; we must become
acquainted with empirical nature, both with the physical
and with the human. The merit of modern times is to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
accomplished or furthered these ends; it was in the highest
degree unsatisfactory when the ancients attempted the
work. Empiricism is not merely an observing, hearing,
feeling, etc., a perception of the individual; for it really sets
to work to find the species, the universal, to discover laws.
Now because it does this, it comes within the territory of
the Notion—it begets what pertains to the region of the
Idea; it thus prepares the empirical material for the Notion,
so that the latter can then receive it ready for its use. If
the science is perfected the Idea must certainly issue forth
of itself; science as such no longer commences from the
empiric. But in order that this science may come into
existence, we must have the progression from the individual
and particular to the universal—an activity which is a reaction
on the given material of empiricism in order to bring
about its reconstruction. The demand of <i>a priori</i> knowledge,
which seems to imply that the Idea should construct from
itself, is thus a reconstruction only, or what is in religion
accomplished through sentiment and feeling. Without the
working out of the empirical sciences on their own account,
Philosophy could not have reached further than with the
ancients. The whole of the Idea in itself is science as perfected
and complete; but the other side is the beginning,
the process of its origination. This process of the origination
of science is different from its process in itself when it is
complete, just as is the process of the history of Philosophy
and that of Philosophy itself. In every science principles
are commenced with; at the first these are the results
of the particular, but if the science is completed they
are made the beginning. The case is similar with
Philosophy; the working out of the empirical side has
really become the conditioning of the Idea, so that this last
may reach its full development and determination. For
instance, in order that the history of the Philosophy of
modern times may exist, we must have a history of Philosophy
in general, the process of Philosophy during so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thousand years; mind must have followed this long road in
order that the Philosophy may be produced. In consciousness
it then adopts the attitude of having cut away the
bridge from behind it; it appears to be free to launch forth
in its ether only, and to develop without resistance in this
medium; but it is another matter to attain to this ether and
to development in it. We must not overlook the fact
that Philosophy would not have come into existence without
this process, for mind is essentially a working upon something
different.</p>

<p>1. Bacon’s fame rests on two works. In the first place,
he has the merit of having in his work <i>De augmentis
scientiarum</i> presented to us a systematic encyclopedia of
the sciences, an outline which must undoubtedly have
caused a sensation amongst his contemporaries. It is important
to set before men’s eyes a well arranged picture
such as this of the whole, when that whole has not been
grasped in thought. This encyclopedia gives a general
classification of the sciences; the principles of the classification
are regulated in accordance with the differences in the
intellectual capacities. Bacon thus divides human learning
according to the faculties of memory, imagination, and
reason, for he distinguishes what pertains (1) to memory;
(2) to imagination; (3) to reason. Under memory he
considered history; under imagination, poetry, and art;
and finally, under reason, philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> According to his
favourite method of division these again are further divided,
since he brings all else under these same heads; this is,
however, unsatisfactory. To history belong the works of
God—sacred, prophetic, ecclesiastical history; the works
of men—civil and literary history; and likewise the works
of nature, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> He goes through these topics after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the manner of his time, a main characteristic of which is
that anything can be made plausible through examples,
<i>e.g.</i> from the Bible. Thus, in treating of <i>Cosmetica</i>, he
says in regard to paint that “He is surprised that this depraved
custom of painting has been by the penal laws both
ecclesiastical and civil so long overlooked. In the Bible
we read indeed of Jezebel that she painted her face; but
nothing of the kind is said of Esther or Judith.”<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> If kings,
popes, etc., are being discussed, such examples as those of
Ahab and Solomon must be brought forward. As formerly
in civil laws—those respecting marriage, for instance—the
Jewish forms held good, in Philosophy, too, the same are
still to be found. In this work theology likewise appears,
as also magic; there is contained in it a comprehensive
system of knowledge and of the sciences.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the sciences is the least significant
part of the work <i>De augmentis scientiarum</i>. It was by its
criticism that its value was established and its effect produced,
as also by the number of instructive remarks contained
in it; all this was at that time lacking in the
particular varieties of learning and modes of discipline,
especially in as far as the methods hitherto adopted were
faulty, and unsuitable to the ends in view: in them the
Aristotelian conceptions of the schools were spun out by
the understanding as though they were realities. As it
was with the Schoolmen and with the ancients, this classification
is still the mode adopted in the sciences, in which
the nature of knowledge is unknown. In them the idea of
the science is advanced beforehand, and to this idea a principle
foreign to it is added, as a basis of division, just as
here is added the distinction between memory, imagination
and reason. The true method of division is found
in the self-division of the Notion, its separating itself from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
itself. In knowledge the moment of self-consciousness is
undoubtedly found, and the real self-consciousness has in
it the moments of memory, imagination and reason. But
this division is certainly not taken from the Notion of
self-consciousness, but from experience, in which self-consciousness
finds itself possessed of these capacities.</p>

<p>2. The other remarkable feature in Bacon is that in his
second work, his <i>Organon</i>, he sought at great length to
establish a new method in learning; in this regard his
name is still held greatly in honour by many. What
chiefly distinguishes his system is his polemical attitude
towards scholastic methods as they had hitherto existed,
towards syllogistic forms. He calls these methods <i>anticipationes
naturæ</i>; in them men begin with presuppositions,
definitions, accepted ideas, with a scholastic
abstraction, and reason further from these without regarding
that which is present in actuality. Thus regarding
God and His methods of operating in nature, regarding
devils, &amp;c., they make use of passages from the Bible, such
as “Sun, stand thou still,” in order to deduce therefrom
certain metaphysical propositions from which they go
further still. It was against this <i>a priori</i> method that
Bacon directed his polemic; as against these anticipations
of nature he called attention to the explanation, the interpretation
of nature.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> “The same action of mind,” he says,
“which discovers a thing in question, judges it; and the
operation is not performed by the help of any middle term,
but directly, almost in the same manner as by the sense.
For the sense in its primary objects at once apprehends the
appearance of the object, and consents to the truth
thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The syllogism is altogether rejected by Bacon.
As a matter of fact, this Aristotelian deduction is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
knowledge through itself in accordance with its content:
it requires a foreign universal as its basis, and for that
reason its movement is in its form contingent. The content
is not in unity with the form, and this form is hence in
itself contingent, because it, considered on its own account,
is the movement onwards in a foreign content. The major
premise is the content existent for itself, the minor is likewise
the content not through itself, for it goes back into the infinite,
<i>i.e.</i> it has not the form in itself; the form is not the
content. The opposite may always be made out equally
well through the syllogism, for it is a matter of indifference
to this form what content is made its basis. “Dialectic does
not assist in the discovery of the arts; many arts were
found out by chance.”<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>It was not against this syllogism generally, <i>i.e.</i> not
against the Notion of it (for Bacon did not possess this),
but against deduction as it was put into operation, as it
was to the scholastics—the deduction which took an
assumed content as its basis—that Bacon declaimed, urging
that the content of experience should be made the basis,
and the method of induction pursued. He demanded that
observations on nature and experiments should be made
fundamental, and pointed out the objects whose investigation
was of special importance in the interests of human
society, and so on. From this there then resulted the establishment
of conclusions through induction and analogy.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
In fact it was only to an alteration in the content that,
without being aware of it, Bacon was impelled. For though
he rejected the syllogism and only permitted conclusions
to be reached through induction, he unconsciously
himself drew deductions; likewise all these champions of
empiricism, who followed after him, and who put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
practice what he demanded, and thought they could by
observations, experiments and experiences, keep the matter
in question pure, could neither so do without drawing
deductions, nor without introducing conceptions; and they
drew their deductions and formed their notions and conceptions
all the more freely because they thought that they
had nothing to do with conceptions at all; nor did they go
forth from deduction to immanent, true knowledge. Thus
when Bacon set up induction in opposition to the syllogism,
this opposition is formal; each induction is also a deduction,
which fact was known even to Aristotle. For if a
universal is deduced from a number of things, the first
proposition reads, “These bodies have these qualities;” the
second, “All these bodies belong to one class;” and thus,
in the third place, this class has these qualities. That is a
perfect syllogism. Induction always signifies that observations
are instituted, experiments made, experience
regarded, and from this the universal determination is
derived.</p>

<p>We have already called to mind how important it is to
lead on to the content as the content of actuality, of the
present; for the rational must have objective truth. The
reconciliation of spirit with the world, the glorification of
nature and of all actuality, must not be a Beyond, a
Futurity, but must be accomplished now and here. It is
this moment of the now and here which thereby comes into
self-consciousness. But those who make experiments and
observations, do not realize what they are really doing, for
the sole interest taken by them in things, is owing to the
inward and unconscious certainty which reason has of finding
itself in actuality; and observations and experiments, if
entered upon in a right way, result in showing that the
Notion is the only objective existence. The sensuous individual
eludes the experiments even while it is being
operated upon, and becomes a universal; the best known
example of this is to be found in positive and negative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
electricity in so far as it is positive and negative.
There is another shortcoming of a formal nature, and one
of which all empiricists partake,—that is that they believe
themselves to be keeping to experience alone; it is to
them an unknown fact that in receiving these perceptions
they are indulging in metaphysics. Man does not stop
short at the individual, nor can he do so. He seeks the universal,
but thoughts, even if not Notions likewise, are what
constitute the same. The most remarkable thought-form
is that of force; we thus speak of the force of electricity,
of magnetism, of gravity. Force, however, is a universal
and not a perceptible; quite uncritically and unconsciously
the empiricists thus permit of determinations such as these.</p>

<p>3. Bacon finally gives the objects with which Philosophy
mainly has to deal. These objects contrast much with
that which we derive from perception and experience. “In
the summary which Bacon gives of what he conceives
ought to be the objects of philosophical inquiry, are the
following; and we select those which he principally dwells
upon in his works: ‘The prolongation of life; the restitution
of youth in some degree; the retardation of old age,
and the altering of statures; the altering of features; versions
of bodies into other bodies; making of new species;
impression of the air and raising tempests; greater pleasures
of the senses, &amp;c.’” He likewise deals with objects
such as these, and he seeks to direct attention upon
whether in their regard the means could not be found to
carry out their ends; in such powers we should be able to
make some progress. “He complains that such investigations
have been neglected by those whom he designates
<i>ignavi regionum exploratores</i>. In his Natural History he
gives formal receipts for making gold, and performing
many wonders.”<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Bacon thus does not by any means take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the intelligent standpoint of an investigation of nature,
being still involved in the grossest superstition, false magic,
&amp;c. This we find to be on the whole propounded in an
intelligent way, and Bacon thus remains within the conceptions
of his time. “The conversion of silver, quicksilver, or
any other metal into gold is a thing difficult to believe, yet
it is far more probable that a man who knows clearly the
natures of weight, of the colour of yellow, of malleability
and extension, of volatility and fixedness, and who has also
made diligent search into the first seeds and menstruums of
minerals, may at last by much and sagacious endeavour
produce gold, than that a few grains of an elixir may so
do.... So again a man who knows well the nature of
rarefaction, of assimilation, and of alimentation, shall by
diets, bathings, and the like prolong life, or in some degree
renew the vigour of youth.”<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> These assertions are thus
not as crude as they at first appear. In dealing with
Medicine Bacon speaks amongst other things of maceration
(<i>Malacissatio per exterius</i>)<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and so forth.</p>

<p>Bacon emphasizes what has reference to the formal
aspect of investigation. For he says, “Natural philosophy
is divided into two parts, the first consists in the investigation
of causes; the second in the production of
effects; the causes to be investigated are either final or
formal causes, or else material or efficient causes. The
former constitutes metaphysics; the latter physics. This
last Bacon looks upon as a branch of philosophy very
inferior in point of dignity and importance to the other
and accordingly to ascertain the most probable means of
improving our knowledge of metaphysics is the great object
of his <i>Organon</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> He himself says: “It is a correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
position that ‘true knowledge is knowledge by causes.
And causes, again, are not improperly distributed into four
kinds: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the
final.’”<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> (Vol. I. p. 174, Vol. II. p. 138.)</p>

<p>But in this connection an important point is that Bacon
has turned against the teleological investigation of nature,
against the investigation into final causes. “The investigation
of final causes is useless; they corrupt rather than
advance the sciences except such as have to do with human
action.”<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> To Bacon the important matter is to investigate
by the study of <i>causæ efficientes</i>. To the consideration of
final causes such assertions as these belong: “That the
hairs of the eyelids are for a protection to the eyes; that
the thick skins and hides of living creatures are to defend
them from heat and cold; that the trees have leaves so
that the fruit may not suffer from sun and wind”<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>: the
hair is on the head on account of warmth; thunder and
lightning are the punishment of God, or else they make
fruitful the earth; marmots sleep during the winter because
they can find nothing to eat; snails have a shell in order
that they may be secure against attacks; the bee is provided
with a sting. According to Bacon this has been
worked out in innumerable different ways. The negative
and external side of utility is turned round, and the lack of
this adaptation to end is likewise drawn within the same
embrace. It may, for example, be said that if sun or moon
were to shine at all times, the police might save much money,
and this would provide men with food and drink for whole
months together. It was right that Bacon should set himself
to oppose this investigation into final causes, because it relates
to external expediency, just as Kant was right in distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the inward teleology from the outward. As against
the external end, there is, in fact, the inward end, <i>i.e.</i> the
inward Notion of the thing itself, as we found it earlier in
Aristotle (Vol. II. pp. 156-163). Because the organism
possesses an inward adaptation to its ends, its members are
indeed likewise externally adapted as regards one another;
but the ends, as external ends, are heterogeneous to the
individual, are unconnected with the object which is
investigated. Speaking generally, the Notion of nature is
not in nature itself, which would mean that the end was
in nature itself; but as teleological, the Notion is something
foreign to it. It does not have the end in itself in such a
way that we have to accord respect to it—as the individual
man has his end in himself and hence has to be respected.
But even the individual man as individual has only a right
to respect from the individual as such, and not from the
universal. He who acts in the name of the universal, of
the state, as a general does for instance, does not require
to respect the individual at all; for the latter, although an
end in himself, does not cease to be relative. He is this
end in himself, not as excluding himself and setting himself
in opposition, but only in so far as his true reality is
the universal Notion. The end of the animal in itself as an
individual is its own self-preservation; but its true end in
itself is the species. Its self-preservation is not involved
in this; for the self-preservation of its individuality is
disadvantageous to the species, while the abrogation of
itself is favourable thereto.</p>

<p>Now Bacon separates the universal principle and the
efficient cause, and for that reason he removes investigation
into ends from physics to metaphysics. Or he recognizes
the Notion, not as universal in nature, but only as necessity,
<i>i.e.</i> as a universal which presents itself in the opposition of
its moments, not one which has bound them into a unity—in
other words he only acknowledges a comprehension of
one determinate from another determinate going on into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
infinity, and not of both from their Notion. Bacon has
thus made investigation into the efficient cause more
general, and he asserts that this investigation alone belongs
to physics, although he allows that both kinds of investigation
may exist side by side.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Through that view he
effected a great deal, and in so far as it has counteracted
the senseless superstition which in the Germanic nations far
exceeded in its horrors and absurdity that of the ancient
world, it has the very merit which we met with in the
Epicurean philosophy. That philosophy opposed itself to
the superstitious Stoics and to superstition generally—which
last makes any existence that we set before ourselves into
a cause (a Beyond which is made to exist in a sensuous
way and to operate as a cause), or makes two sensuous
things which have no relation operate on one another.
This polemic of Bacon’s against spectres, astrology, magic,
&amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> can certainly not be regarded exactly as Philosophy
like his other reflections, but it is at least of service to
culture.</p>

<p>He also advises that attention should be directed to
formal causes, the forms of things, and that they should be
recognized.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> “But to give an exact definition of the meaning
which Bacon attaches to the phrase formal causes is
rather difficult; because his language upon this subject is
uncertain in a very remarkable degree.”<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It may be thought
that he understood by this the immanent determinations of
things, the laws of nature; as a matter of fact the forms
are none else than universal determinations, species, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
He says: “The discovery of the formal is despaired of.
The efficient and the material (as they are investigated and
received, that is as remote causes, without reference to the
latent process leading to the forms) are but slight and superficial,
and contribute little, if anything, to true and active
science. For though in nature nothing really exists beside
individual bodies, performing pure individual acts according
to a fixed law, yet in philosophy this very law, and
the investigation, discovery and explanation of it, is the
foundation as well of knowledge as of operation. And it is
this law, with its clauses, that I mean when I speak of
Forms.... Let the investigation of Forms which are
eternal and immutable constitute metaphysics. Whosoever
is acquainted with Forms embraces the unity of nature in
substances the most unlike.”<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> He goes through this in
detail, and quotes many examples to illustrate it, such as
that of Heat. “Mind must raise itself from differences to
species. The warmth of the sun and that of the fire are
diverse. We see that grapes ripen by the warmth of the
sun. But to see whether the warmth of the sun is specific,
we also observe other warmth, and we find that grapes
likewise ripen in a warm room; this proves that the
warmth of the sun is not specific.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>“Physic,” he says, “directs us through narrow rugged
paths in imitation of the crooked ways of nature. But
he that understands a form knows the ultimate possibility
of superinducing that nature upon all kinds of matter;
that is to say, as he himself interprets this last expression,
is able to superinduce the nature of gold upon
silver,” that is to say to make gold from silver, “and to
perform all those other marvels to which the alchymists
pretended. The error of these last consisted alone in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
hoping to arrive at these ends by fabulous and fantastical
methods;” the true method is to recognize these forms.
“One leading object of the <i>Instauratio Magna</i> and of the
<i>Novum Organon</i> is to point out the necessity of ascertaining
the formal causes and logical rules.”<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> They are good
rules, but not adapted to attain that end.</p>

<p>This is all that we have to say of Bacon. In dealing
with Locke we shall have more to say of these empirical
methods which were adopted by the English.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c188">B. <span class="smcap">Jacob Boehme.</span></a></h2>

<p>We now pass on from this English Lord Chancellor, the
leader of the external, sensuous method in Philosophy, to
the <i>philosophus teutonicus</i>, as he is called—to the German
cobbler of Lusatia, of whom we have no reason to be
ashamed. It was, in fact, through him that Philosophy
first appeared in Germany with a character peculiar to
itself: Boehme stands in exact antithesis to Bacon. He
was also called <i>theosophus teutonicus</i>, just as even before
this <i>philosophia teutonica</i> was the name given to mysticism.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
This Jacob Boehme was for long forgotten and decried as
being simply a pious visionary; the so-called period of enlightenment,
more particularly, helped to render his public
extremely limited. Leibnitz thought very highly of
him, but it is in modern times that his profundity has for
the first time been recognized, and that he has been once
more restored to honour. It is certain, on the one hand,
that he did not merit the disdain accorded him; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
other, however, he did not deserve the high honour into
which he was elevated. To call him an enthusiast signifies
nothing at all. For if we will, all philosophers may be so
termed, even the Epicureans and Bacon; for they all have
held that man finds his truth in something else than eating
and drinking, or in the common-sense every-day life of
wood-cutting, tailoring, trading, or other business, private
or official. But Boehme has to attribute the high honour
to which he was raised mainly to the garb of sensuous
feeling and perception which he adopted; for ordinary
sensuous perception and inward feeling, praying and
yearning, and the pictorial element in thought, allegories
and such like, are in some measure held to be essential in
Philosophy. But it is only in the Notion, in thought, that
Philosophy can find its truth, and that the Absolute can be
expressed and likewise is as it is in itself. Looked at from
this point of view, Boehme is a complete barbarian, and
yet he is a man who, along with his rude method of presentation,
possesses a deep, concrete heart. But because no
method or order is to be found in him, it is difficult to give
an account of his philosophy.</p>

<p>Jacob Boehme was born in 1575 of poor parents, at
Altseidenburg, near Görlitz, in Upper Lusatia. In his youth
he was a peasant boy who tended the cattle. He was
brought up as a Lutheran, and always remained such.
The account of his life which is given with his works was
drawn up by a clergyman who knew him personally, from
information given by Boehme himself. Much is there
related as to how he attained to more profound knowledge
and wisdom by means of certain experiences through
which he passed. Even when a herd tending the cattle,
as he tells of himself, he had these wonderful manifestations.
The first marvellous awakening that occurred to him took
place in a thicket in which he saw a cavern and a vessel of
gold. Startled by the splendour of this sight he was
inwardly awakened from a dull stupor, but afterwards he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
found it was impossible for him to discover the objects of his
vision. Subsequently he was bound apprentice to a shoemaker.
More especially “was he spiritually awakened by
the words: ‘Your heavenly Father will give the Holy
Spirit to them that ask Him’ (Luke xi. 13), so that,
desiring to come to a knowledge of the truth, and yet retaining
the simplicity of his mind, he prayed and sought, and
knocked, fervently and earnestly, until, while travelling
about with his master, he was, through the influence of the
Father in the Son, spiritually transported into the glorious
peace and the Sabbath of the soul, and thus his request
was granted. According to his own account, he was then
surrounded with divine light, and for seven days he
remained in the supremest divine contemplation and joy.”
His master for this dismissed him, saying he could not
keep in his service “house-prophets such as he was.” After
that he lived at Görlitz. In 1594 he rose in his trade to be
master, and married. Later on, “in the year 1600, and in
the twenty-fifth year of his age, once more” the light
broke upon him in a second vision of the same kind. He
tells that he saw a brightly scoured pewter dish in the room,
and “by the sudden sight of this shining metal with its
brilliant radiance” he was brought (into a meditation and
a breaking free of his astral mind) “into the central point of
secret nature,” and into the light of divine essence. “He
went out into the open air in order that he might rid his
brain of this hallucination, and none the less did he continue
all the more clearly as time went on to experience the
vision in this way received. Thus by means of the
signatures or figures, lineaments, and colours which were
depicted, he could, so to speak, look into the heart and
inmost nature of all creatures (in his book <i>De signatura
rerum</i> this reason which was impressed upon him is found
and fully explained); and for this he was overwhelmed
with joy, thanked God, and went peacefully about his
affairs.” Later on he wrote several works. He continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to pursue his handicraft at Görlitz, and died at the same
place in 1624, being then a master shoemaker.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>His works are especially popular with the Dutch, and
for that reason most of the editions are issued from
Amsterdam, though they were also surreptitiously printed
in Hamburg. His first writing is the “Aurora” or
“Morgenröthe im Aufgange,” and this was followed by
others; the work “Von den drei Principien,” and another
“Vom dreifachen Leben des Menschen,” are, along with
several others, the most noteworthy. Boehme constantly
read the Bible, but what other works he read is not known.
A number of passages in his works, however, prove that he
read much—evidently mystical, theosophic, and alchemistic
writings for the most part, and he must certainly have
included in his reading the works of Theophrastus
Bombastus von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus, a philosopher
of a somewhat similar calibre, but much more confused,
and without Boehme’s profundity of mind. He met
with much persecution at the hands of the clergy, but he
aroused less attention in Germany than in Holland and
England, where his writings have been often printed.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In
reading his works we are struck with wonder, and one must
be familiar with his ideas in order to discover the truth in
this most confused method of expression.</p>

<p>The matter of Jacob Boehme’s philosophy is genuinely
German; for what marks him out and makes him noteworthy
is the Protestant principle already mentioned of
placing the intellectual world within one’s own mind and
heart, and of experiencing and knowing and feeling in
one’s own self-consciousness all that formerly was conceived
as a Beyond. Boehme’s general conceptions thus
on the one hand reveal themselves as both deep and sound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but on the other, with all his need for and struggle after
determination and distinction in the development of his
divine intuitions of the universe, he does not attain either
to clearness or order. There is no systematic connection
but the greatest confusion in his divisions—and this exists
even in his tables,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> in which three numbers are made use of.</p>

<p>Here nothing definite to hold the moments asunder is
shown, and we have the sense of merely doing it by effort;
now these and now other distinctions are set forth, and as
they are laid down disconnectedly, they again come into
confusion.</p>

<p>The manner and system which Boehme adopts must
accordingly be termed barbarous; the expressions used in
his works prove this, as when, for example, he speaks of
the divine Salitter, Marcurius, &amp;c. As Boehme places the
life, the movement of absolute existence in the heart, so
does he regard all conceptions as being in a condition of
actuality; or he makes use of actuality as Notion, that is
to say he forcibly takes natural things and sensuous
qualities to express his ideas rather than the determinations
of the Notion. For instance, sulphur and such like are not
to him the things that we so name, but their essence; or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Notion has this form of actuality. Boehme’s profoundest
interest is in the Idea, and he struggles hard to express it.
The speculative truth which he desires to expound really
requires, in order to be comprehended, thought and the
form of thought. Only in thought can this unity be comprehended,
in the central point of which his mind has its
place; but it is just the form of thought that is lacking to
him. The forms that he employs are really no longer
determinations of the Notion at all. They are on the one
hand sensuous, chemical determinations, such qualities as
acid, sweet, sour, fierce, and, on the other, emotions such as
wrath and love; and, further, tincture, essence, anguish, &amp;c.
For him these sensuous forms do not, however, possess
the sensuous significance which belongs to them, but he
uses them in order to find expression for his thought. It
is, however, at once clear to us how the form of manifestation
must necessarily appear forced, since thought alone is
capable of unity. It thus appears strange to read of the
bitterness of God, of the <i>Flagrat</i>, and of lightning; we
first require to have the Idea, and then we certainly
discern its presence here. But the other side is that
Boehme utilizes the Christian form which lies nearest to
him, and more especially that of the Trinity, as the form
of the Idea: he intermingles the sensuous mode and the
mode of popularly conceived religion, sensuous images and
conceptions. However rude and barbarous this may on the
one hand be, and however impossible it is to read Boehme
continuously, or to take a firm grasp of his thoughts (for
all these qualities, spirits and angels make one’s head swim),
we must on the other hand recognize that he speaks of
everything as it is in its actuality, and that he does this
from his heart. This solid, deep, German mind which
has intercourse with what is most inward, thus really
exercises an immense power and force in order to make
use of actuality as Notion, and to have what takes place in
heaven around and within it. Just as Hans Sachs represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
God, Christ and the Holy Ghost, as well as patriarchs
and angels, in his own particular manner and as ordinary
people like himself, not looking upon them as past and
historic, so was it with Boehme.</p>

<p>To faith spirit has truth, but in this truth the moment of
certainty of self is lacking. We have seen that the object
of Christianity is the truth, the Spirit; it is given to faith
as immediate truth. Faith possesses the truth, but unconsciously,
without knowledge, without knowing it as its
self-consciousness; and seeing that thought, the Notion,
is necessarily in self-consciousness—the unity of opposites
with Bruno—this unity is what is pre-eminently
lacking to faith. Its moments as particular forms fall
apart, more especially the highest moments—good and
evil, or God and the Devil. God is, and the Devil likewise;
both exist for themselves. But if God is absolute existence,
the question may be asked, What absolute existence is
this which has not all actuality, and more particularly evil
within it? Boehme is hence on one side intent on leading
the soul of man to the divine life, on inducing the soul to
pay attention to the strife within itself, and make this the
object of all its work and efforts; and then in respect of
this content he strives to make out how evil is present in
good—a question of the present day. But because Boehme
does not possess the Notion and is so far back in intellectual
culture, there ensues a most frightful and
painful struggle between his mind and consciousness and
his powers of expression, and the import of this struggle
is the profoundest Idea of God which seeks to bring the
most absolute opposites into unity, and to bind them together—but
not for thinking reason. Thus if we would
comprehend the matter, Boehme’s great struggle has
been—since to him God is everything—to grasp the
negative, evil, the devil, in and from God, to grasp God
as absolute; and this struggle characterizes all his writings
and brings about the torture of his mind. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
requires a great and severe mental effort to bring
together in one what in shape and form lie so far
asunder; with all the strength that he possesses Boehme
brings the two together, and therein shatters all the immediate
significance of actuality possessed by both. But
when thus he grasps this movement, this essence of spirit
in himself, in his inward nature, the determination of the
moments simply approaches more nearly to the form of
self-consciousness, to the formless, or to the Notion. In
the background, indeed, there stands the purest speculative
thought, but it does not attain to an adequate representation.
Homely, popular modes of conception likewise appear, a
free out-spokenness which to us seems too familiar. With
the devil, particularly, he has great dealings, and him he
frequently addresses. “Come here,” he says, “thou
black wretch, what dost thou want? I will give thee a
potion.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> As Prospero in Shakespeare’s “Tempest”<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
threatens Ariel that he will “rend an oak and peg him in
his knotty entrails ... twelve winters,” Boehme’s great
mind is confined in the hard knotty oak of the senses—in
the gnarled concretion of the ordinary conception—and
is not able to arrive at a free presentation of the
Idea.</p>

<p>I shall shortly give Boehme’s main conceptions, and then
several particular forms which he in turn adopts; for he
does not remain at one form, because neither the sensuous
nor the religious can suffice. Now even though this brings
about the result that he frequently repeats himself, the
forms of his main conceptions are still in every respect
very different, and he who would try to give a consistent
explanation of Boehme’s ideas, particularly when they pass
into further developments, would only delude himself in
making the attempt. Hence we must neither expect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
find in Boehme a systematic presentation nor a true method
of passing over into the individual. Of his thoughts we
cannot say much without adopting his manner of expression,
and quoting the particular passages themselves, for they
cannot otherwise be expressed. The fundamental idea in
Jacob Boehme is the effort to comprise everything in an
absolute unity, for he desires to demonstrate the absolute
divine unity and the union of all opposites in God.
Boehme’s chief, and one may even say, his only thought—the
thought that permeates all his works—is that of perceiving
the holy Trinity in everything, and recognizing
everything as its revelation and manifestation, so that it is
the universal principle in which and through which everything
exists; in such a way, moreover, that all things have
this divine Trinity in themselves, not as a Trinity pertaining
to the ordinary conception, but as the real Trinity of the
absolute Idea. Everything that exists is, according to
Boehme, this three-fold alone, and this three-fold is everything.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
To him the universe is thus one divine life and
revelation of God in all things, so that when examined
more closely, from the one reality of God, the sum and
substance of all powers and qualities, the Son who shines
forth from these powers is eternally born; the inward
unity of this light with the substance of the powers is
Spirit. Sometimes the presentation is vague, and then
again it is clearer. What comes next is the explanation of
this Trinity, and here the different forms which he uses to
indicate the difference becoming evident in the same, more
especially appear.</p>

<p>In the <i>Aurora</i>, the “Root or Mother of Philosophy,
Astrology and Theology,” he gives a method of division in
which he places these sciences in proximity, and yet appears
merely to pass from one to the other without any clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
definition or determination. “(1) In Philosophy divine
power is treated of, what God is, and how in the Being of
God nature, stars and <i>Elementa</i> are constituted; whence
all things have their origin, what is the nature of heaven
and earth, as also of angels, men and devils, heaven and
hell and all that is creaturely, likewise what the two qualities
in nature are, and this is dealt with out of a right
ground in the knowledge of spirit, by the impulse and
motion of God. (2) In astrology the powers of nature, of
the stars and elements, are treated of, and how all creatures
proceed from them, how evil and good are through them
effected in men and animals. (3) In theology the kingdom
of Christ is dealt with, as also its nature, and how it is set
in opposition to hell, and how in nature it wars with the
kingdom of darkness.”<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>1. What comes first is God the Father; this first is at
once divided in itself and the unity of both its parts.
“God is all,” he says, “He is the Darkness and the Light,
Love and Anger, Fire and Light, but He calls Himself
God only as to the light of His love. There is an eternal
<i>Contrarium</i> between darkness and light; neither comprehends
the other and neither is the other, and yet there is
but one essence or substance, though separated by pain; it
is likewise so with the will, and yet there is no separable
essence. One single principle is divided in this way, that
one is in the other as a nothing which yet exists; but it is
not manifest in the property of that thing in which it is.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
By anguish is expressed that which we know as the absolute
negativity—that is the self-conscious, self-experienced, the
self-relating negativity which is therefore absolute affirmation.
All Boehme’s efforts were directed towards this
point; the principle of the Notion is living in him, only he
cannot express it in the form of thought. That is to say, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
depends on thinking of the negative as simple, since it is at
the same time an opposite; thus anguish [Qual] is the inward
tearing asunder and yet likewise the simple. From this
Boehme derives sources or springs [Quellen], a good play
on the words. For pain [die Qual], this negativity, passes
into life, activity, and thus he likewise connects it with
quality [Qualität], which he makes into Quallity.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The
absolute identity of difference is all through present to
him.</p>

<p>a. Boehme thus represents God not as the empty unity,
but as this self-separating unity of absolute opposites; one
must not, however, here expect a clearly defined distinction.
The first, the one, the Father, has likewise the
mode of natural existence; thus, like Proclus, he speaks
of this God being simple essence. This simple essence he
calls the hidden; and he therefore names it the <i>Temperamentum</i>,
this unity of what is different, in which all is tempered.
We find him also calling it the great Salitter—now
the divine and now the natural Salitter—as well as Salniter.
When he talks of this great salitter as of something known
to us, we cannot first of all conceive what it means. But
it is a vulgar corruption of the word <i>sal nitri</i>, saltpetre
(which is still called salniter in Austria), <i>i.e.</i> just the
neutral and in truth universal existence. The divine pomp
and state is this, that in God a more glorious nature dwells,
trees, plants, &amp;c. “In the divine pomp or state two things
have principally to be considered; salitter or the divine
power, which brings forth all fruits, and marcurius or the
sound.”<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> This great salitter is the unrevealed existence,
just as the Neo-Platonic unity is without knowledge of
itself and likewise unrecognized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>b. This first substance contains all powers or qualities
as not yet separated; thus this salitter likewise appears as
the body of God, who embraces all qualities in Himself.
Quality thus becomes an important conception, the first
determination with Boehme; and he begins with qualities
in his work “Morgenröthe im Aufgang.” He afterwards
associates with this the conferring of quality, and in the
same place says: “Quality is the mobility, boiling, springing,
and driving of a thing.” These qualities he then
tries to define, but the account he gives of them is vague.
“As for example heat which burns, consumes and drives
forth all whatsoever comes into it which is not of the
same property; and again it enlightens and warms all
cold, wet, and dark things; it compacts and hardens soft
things. It contains likewise two other kinds in it, namely
Light and Fierceness” (Negativity); “of which the light
or the heart of the heat is in itself a pleasant, joyful glance
or lustre, a power of life ... and a source of the
heavenly kingdom of joy. For it makes all things in this
world living and moving; all flesh, trees, leaves, and grass
grow in this world, as in the power of the light, and have
their light therein, viz. in the good. Again, it contains
also a fierceness or wrath which burns, consumes and
spoils. This wrath or fierceness springs, drives, and elevates
itself in the light, and makes the light movable. It
wrestles and fights together in its two-fold source. The
light subsists in God without heat, but it does not subsist
so in nature. For all qualities in nature are one in another,
in the same manner as God is all. For God” (the
Father) “is the Heart.” On another occasion (Vom dreifachen
Leben des Menschen, chap. iv. § 68, p. 881) the Son
is the heart of God; and yet again the Spirit is called the
heart (Morgenröthe, chap. ii. § 13, p. 29) “or fountain of
nature, and from Him comes all. Now heat reigns and
predominates in all powers in nature and warms all, and is
one source or spring in all. But the light in the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gives power to all qualities, for that all grow pleasant and
joyful.” Boehme goes over quite a list of qualities: cold,
hot, bitter, sweet, fierce, acid, hard, dense, soft qualities,
sound, etc. “The bitter quality is in God also, but not in
that manner as the gall is in man, but it is an everlasting
power, in an elevating, triumphing spring or source
of joy. All the creatures are made from these qualities,
and live therein as in their mother.”<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>“The virtues of the stars are nature itself. Everything
in this world proceeds from the stars. That I shall prove
to you if you are not a blockhead and have a little reason.
If the whole <i>Curriculum</i> or the whole circumference of the
stars is considered, we soon find that this is the mother of
all things, or the nature from which all things have arisen
and in which all things stand and live, and through which
all things move. And all things are formed from these
same powers and remain eternally therein.” Thus it is
said that God is the reality of all realities. Boehme continues:
“You must, however, elevate your mind in the
Spirit, and consider how the whole of nature, with all the
powers which are in nature, also extension, depth and
height, also heaven and earth and all whatsoever is therein,
and all that is above the heavens, is together the Body
and Corporeity of God; and the powers of the stars are the
fountain veins in the natural Body of God, in this world.
You must not conceive that in the Body of the stars is the
whole triumphing Holy Trinity, God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. But we must not so conceive as if God was
not at all in the <i>Corpus</i> or Body of the stars, and in this
world.... Here now the question is, From whence has
heaven, or whence borrows it this power, that it causes
such mobility in nature? Here you must lift up your eyes
beyond nature into the light, holy, triumphing, divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
power, into the unchangeable holy Trinity, which is a
triumphing, springing, movable Being, and all powers are
therein, as in nature: of this heaven, earth, stars, elements,
devils, angels, men, beasts, and all have their Being; and
therein all stands. When we nominate heaven and earth,
stars and elements, and all that is therein, and all whatsoever
is above the heaven, then thereby is nominated the
total God, who has made Himself creaturely in these above-mentioned”
many “Beings, in His power which proceedeth
forth from Him.”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>c. Boehme further defines God the Father as follows:
“When we consider the whole nature and its property,
then we see the Father: when we behold heaven and the
stars, then we behold His eternal power and wisdom. So
many stars as stand in the whole heaven, which are innumerable,
so manifold and various is the power and
wisdom of God the Father. Every star differs in its
quality.” But “you must not conceive here that every
power which is in the Father stands in a peculiar severed
or divided part and place in the Father, as the stars do in
heaven. No, but the Spirit shows that all the powers in
the Father,” as the fountainhead, “are one in another as
one power.” This whole is the universal power which
exists as God the Father, wherein all differences are united;
“creaturely” it, however, exists as the totality of stars,
and thus as separation into the different qualities. “You
must not think that God who is in heaven and above the
heaven does there stand and hover like a power and quality
which has in it neither reason nor knowledge, as the sun
which turns round in its circle and shoots forth from itself
heat and light, whether it be for benefit or hurt to the
earth and creatures. No, the Father is not so, but He is
an All-mighty, All-wise, All-knowing, All-seeing, All-hearing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
All-smelling, All-tasting God, who in Himself is
meek, friendly, gracious, merciful, and full of joy, yea Joy
itself.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Since Boehme calls the Father all powers, he again distinguishes
these as the seven first originating spirits.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
But there is a certain confusion in this and no thought-determination,
no definite reason for there being exactly
seven—such precision and certainty is not to be found in
Boehme. These seven qualities are likewise the seven
planets which move and work in the great Salitter of God;
“the seven planets signify the seven spirits of God or the
princes of the angels.” But they are in the Father as one
unity, and this unity is an inward spring and fermentation.
“In God all spirits triumph as one spirit, and a spirit ever
calms and loves the others, and nothing exists excepting
mere joy and rapture. One spirit does not stand alongside
the others like stars in heaven, for all seven are contained
within one another as one spirit. Each spirit in the seven
spirits of God is pregnant with all seven spirits of God;”
thus each is in God itself a totality. “One brings forth
the other in and through itself;” this is the flashing forth
of the life of all qualities.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>2. As what came first was the source and germ of all
powers and qualities, what comes second is process. This
second principle is a very important conception, which
with Boehme appears under very many aspects and forms,
viz. as the Word, the Separator, Revelation—speaking
generally the “I,” the source of all difference, and of
the will and implicit Being which are in the powers of
natural things; but in such a way that the light therein
likewise breaks forth which leads them back to rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>a. God as the simple absolute existence is not God
absolutely; in Him nothing can be known. What we
know is something different—but this “different” is itself
contained in God as the perception and knowledge of God.
Hence of the second step Boehme says that a separation
must have taken place in this temperament. “No thing
can become manifest to itself without opposition; for if
it has nothing to withstand it, it always goes forward on
its own account and does not go back within itself. But
if it does not go back into itself as into that from which it
originally arose, it knows nothing of its original state.”
Original state [Urstand] he makes use of for substance;
and it is a pity that we cannot use this and many other
striking expressions. “Without adversity life would have
no sensibility nor will nor efficacy, neither understanding
nor science. Had the hidden God who is one solitary
existence and will not of His own will brought Himself
out of Himself, out of the eternal knowledge in the
<i>Temperamento</i>, into divisibility of will, and introduced this
same element of divisibility into an inclusiveness” (Identity)
“so as to constitute it a natural and creaturely life,
and had this element of separation in life not come into
warfare, how was the will of God which is only one to be
revealed to Himself? How could a knowledge of itself be
present in a solitary will?”<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> We see that Boehme is
elevated infinitely above the empty abstraction of the
highest reality, etc.</p>

<p>Boehme continues: “The commencement of all Beings
is the Word as the breath of God, and God has become
the eternal One of eternity and likewise remains so in
eternity. The Word is the eternal beginning and remains
so eternally, for it is the revelation of the eternal One
through and by which the divine power is brought into
one knowledge of somewhat. By the Word we understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the revealed will of God: by the Word we mean God the
hidden God, from whom the Word eternally springs forth.
The Word is the efflux of the divine One, and yet God
Himself as His revelation.” Λόγος is more definite than
Word, and there is a delightful double significance in the
Greek expression indicating as it does both reason and
speech. For speech is the pure existence of spirit; it is a
thing which when once heard goes back within itself.
“What has flowed out is wisdom, beginning and cause of
all powers, colours, virtue and qualities.”<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Of the Son Boehme says: “The Son is” of the Father
and “in the Father, the heart of the Father or light, and
the Father beareth him ever, from eternity to eternity.”
Thus “the Son is” indeed “another Person from the
Father, though no other,” but the same “God as the
Father,” whose image he is.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> “The Son is the Heart”
or the pulsating element “in the Father; all the powers
which are in the Father are the propriety of the Father;
and the Son is the heart or the kernel in all the powers
in the whole Father, and he is the cause of the springing
joy in all powers in the whole Father. From the Son the
eternal joy rises and springs in all the powers of the
Father, as the sun does in the heart of the stars. It
signifies the Son, as the circle of the stars signifies the
manifold powers of the Father; it lightens the heavens,
the stars and the deep above the earth, working in all
things that are in this world; it enlightens and gives
power to all the stars and tempers their power. The Son
of God is continually generated from all the powers of his
Father from eternity, just as the sun is born of the stars;
He is ever born and is not made, and is the heart and
lustre shining forth from all powers. He shines in all
powers of the Father, and his power is the moving, springing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
joy in all the powers of the Father, and shines in the
whole Father as the sun does in the whole world. For if
the Son did not shine in the Father, the Father would be
a dark valley; for the Father’s power would not rise from
eternity to eternity, and so the divine Being would not
subsist.”<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This life of the Son is an important matter;
and in regard to this issuing forth and manifestation
Boehme has likewise brought forward the most important
assertions.</p>

<p>b. “From such a revelation of powers in which the will
of the eternal One contemplates itself, flows the understanding
and the knowledge of the something [Ichts],
since the eternal will contemplates itself in the something
[Ichts].” “Ichts” is a play upon the word “Nichts”
(nothing), for it is simply the negative; yet it is at the same
time the opposite of nothing, since the Ich (Ego) of self-consciousness
is contained in it. The Son, the something,
is thus “I,” consciousness, self-consciousness: God is
not only the abstract neutral but likewise the gathering
together of Himself into the point of Being-for-self. The
“other” of God is thus the image of God. “This similitude
is the <i>Mysterium magnum</i>, viz. the creator of all beings
and creatures; for it is the separator” (of the whole) “in
the efflux of the will which makes the will of the eternal
One separable—the separability in the will from which
powers and qualities take their rise.” This separator is
“constituted the steward of nature, by whom the eternal
will rules, makes, forms and constitutes all things.” The
separator is effectuating and self-differentiating, and Boehme
calls this “Ichts,” likewise Lucifer, the first-born Son of
God, the creaturely first-born angel who was one of the
seven spirits. “But this Lucifer has fallen and Christ has
come in his place.”<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This is the connection of the devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
with God, namely other-Being and then Being-for-self or
Being-for-one, in such a way that the other is for one;
and this is the origin of evil in God and out of God. This
is the furthest point of thought reached by Jacob Boehme.
He represents this Fall of Lucifer as that the “Ichts,” <i>i.e.</i>
self-knowledge, the “I” [Ichheit] (a word which we find
used by him), the inward imagining of self, the inward
fashioning of self (the being-for-self), is the fire which
absorbs all things. This is the negative side in the
separator, the anguish; or it is the wrath of God. This
divine wrath is hell and the devil, who through himself
imagines himself into himself. This is very bold and
speculative; Boehme here seeks to show in God Himself
the sources of the divine anger. He also calls the will of
the something [“Ichts”] self-hood; it is the passing over
of the something [“Ichts”] into the nothing [Nichts],
the “I” imagining itself within itself. He says: “Heaven
and hell are as far removed from one another as day and
night, as something and nothing.” Boehme has really here
penetrated into the utmost depths of divine essence; evil,
matter, or whatever it has been called, is the I&nbsp;=&nbsp;I, the
Being-for-self, the true negativity. Before this it was the
<i>nonens</i> which is itself positive, the darkness; but the true
negativity is the “I.” It is not anything bad because it is
called the evil; it is in mind alone that evil exists, because
it is conceived therein as it is in itself. “Where the will
of God willeth in anything, there God is manifested, and in
that manifestation the angels also dwell; but where God
in any thing willeth not with the will of the thing, there
God is not manifested to it, but dwelleth” (there) “in
Himself without the co-operating of the thing;” in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
case “in that thing is its own will, and there the devil
dwelleth and all whatever is without God.”<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Boehme in his own way sets forth the form further
assumed in this process in a pictorial manner. This
“<i>Separator</i> deduces qualities from itself, from which the
infinite manifold arises, and through which the eternal One
makes itself perceptible” (so that it is for others) “not
according to the unity, but in accordance with the efflux of
the unity.” Implicit Being and the manifold are absolutely
opposed through the Notion, which Boehme did not have:
Being-for-self implies Being-for-another and retrogression
into the opposite. Boehme sways backwards and forwards
in apparent contradictions, and does not well know how to
find a way out of the difficulty. “But the efflux is carried
on to the greatest extreme possible, to the generation of
fire”—dark fire without light, darkness, the hidden, the
self;<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>—“in which fiery nature,” however, since this fire
rises and shoots up, “the eternal One becomes majestic and
a light,” and this light which there breaks forth is the
form which the other principle assumes. This is the return
to the One. “Thereby” (through fire) “the eternal power
becomes desirous and effectual and” (fire) “is the original
condition” (essence) “of the sensitive” (feeling) “life,
where in the Word of power an eternal sensitive life
first takes its origin. For if life had no sensitiveness, it
would have no will nor efficacy; but pain”—anguish,
suffering—first “makes it” (all life) “effectual and endows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it with will. And the light of such kindling through fire
makes it joyous, for it is an anointment,” joy and loveliness
“of painfulness.”<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Boehme turns this round in many ways in order to grasp
the something [Ichts], the Separator, as it “rises”<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> from
the Father. The qualities rise in the great Salitter, stir,
raise, and move [rügen] themselves. Boehme has there the
quality of astringency in the Father, and he then represents
the process of the something [Ichts] as a sharpness, a drawing
together, as a flash of lightning that breaks forth. This
light is Lucifer. The Being-for-self, the self-perception, is by
Boehme called the drawing together into a point. That is
astringency, sharpness, penetration, fierceness; to this pertains
the wrath of God, and here Boehme in this manner
grasps the “other” of God in God Himself. “This source
can be kindled through great motion or elevation. Through
the contraction the creaturely Being is formed so that a
heavenly <i>Corpus</i> may be” intelligibly “formed. But if
it”—the sharpness—“be kindled through elevation, which
those creatures only can do which are created out of the
divine Salitter, then it is a burning source-vein of the
wrath of God. The flash is the mother of light; for the
flash generates the light, and is the Father of the fierceness;
for the fierceness abides in the flash as a seed in the
father, and that flash generates also the tone or sound”—the
flash is, speaking generally, the absolute generator.
The flash is still connected with pain; light is what brings
intelligence. The divine birth is the going forth of the
flash, of the life of all qualities.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This is all from the
Aurora.</p>

<p>In the <i>Quæstionibus theosophicis</i> Boehme makes particular
use of the form of Yes and No for the separator, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
this opposition. He says: “The reader must know that
in Yes and No all things consist, whether divine, devilish,
earthly, or what they may be called. The One as the
Yes is pure power and life, and it is the truth of God or
God Himself. He would be unknowable in Himself, and
in Him there would be no joy nor elevation, nor feeling”—life—“without
the No. The No is a counterstroke of
the Yes, or of the truth” (this negativity is the principle
of all knowledge, comprehension), “that the truth may
be manifest and be a something wherein there is a
<i>contrarium</i> in which there is the eternal love, moving, feeling,
and willing, and demanding to be loved. And yet
we cannot say that the Yes is separated from the No, and
that they are two things in proximity; for they are only
one thing, but they separate themselves into two beginnings
and make two <i>centra</i>, where each works and wills in itself.
Without those two, which are continually in strife, all things
would be a nothing, and would stand still without movement.
If the eternal will did not itself flow from itself and
introduce itself into receptibility, there would be no form
nor distinction, for all powers would” then “be one power.
Neither could there be understanding in that case,
for the understanding arises” (has its substance) “in
the differentiation of the manifold, where one property
sees, proves and wills the others. The will which
has flowed out wills dissimilarity, so that it may be distinguished
from similarity and be its own something—and
that something may exist, that the eternal seeing may see
and feel. And from the individual will arises the No, for it
brings itself into ownness, <i>i.e.</i> receptivity of self. It desires
to be something and does not make itself in accordance
with unity; for unity is a Yes which flows forth, which
ever stands thus in the breathing forth of itself, being
imperceptible; for it has nothing in which it can find
itself excepting in the receptivity of the dissentient
will, as in the No which is counterstroke to the Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in which the Yes is indeed revealed, and in which
it possesses something which it can will. And the No is
therefore called a No, because it is a desire turned inwards
on itself, as if it were a shutting up into negativity. The
emanated seeking will is absorbent and comprehends itself
within itself, from it come forms and qualities: (1) Sharpness,
(2) Motion, (3) Feeling. (4) The fourth property is
Fire as the flash of light; this rises in the bringing
together of the great and terrible sharpness and the unity.
Thus in the contact a <i>Flagrat</i> [Schrack] results, and in
this <i>Flagrat</i> [Schrack] unity is apprehended as being a
Flash or Gleam, an exulting joy.” That is the bursting
forth of the unity. “For thus the light arises in the
midst of the darkness, for the unity becomes a light, and
the receptivity of the carnal will in the qualities becomes a
Spirit-fire which has its source and origin out of the sharp,
cold astringency. And according to that, God is an
angry” and “jealous God,” and in this we have evil.
“(<i>a</i>) The first quality of the absorption is the No; (<i>b</i>) Sharpness;
(<i>c</i>) Hardness; (<i>d</i>) Feeling; (<i>e</i>) the source of fire, hell
or hollowness, Hiddenness. (5) The fifth quality, Love,
makes in the fire, as in pain, another <i>Principium</i> as a great
fire of love.”<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> These are the main points under the
second head. In such depths Boehme keeps struggling
on, for to him conceptions are lacking, and there are only
religious and chemical forms to be found; and because he
uses these in a forced sense in order to express his ideas,
not only does barbarism of expression result, but incomprehensibility
as well.</p>

<p>c. “From this eternal operation of the sensation the
visible world sprang; the world is the Word which has
flowed forth and has disposed itself into qualities, since
in qualities the particular will has arisen. The <i>Separator</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
has made it a will of its own after such a fashion.”<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The
world is none other than the essence of God made creaturely.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Hence “If thou beholdest the Deep” of the
heavens, “the Stars, the Elements and the Earth,” and
what they have brought forth, “then thou” certainly
“comprehendest not with thy eyes the bright and clear
Deity, though indeed it is” likewise “there and in them.”
Thou seest only their creaturely manifestation. “But if thou
raisest thy thoughts and considerest ... God who rules
in holiness in this government or dominion, then thou
breakest through the heaven of heavens and apprehendest
God at His holy heart. The powers of heaven ever operate
in images, growths and colours, in order to reveal the holy
God, so that He may be in all things known.”<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>3. Finally what comes third in these three-fold forms is
the unity of the light, of the separator and power: this is
the spirit, which is already partially implied in what has
preceded. “All the stars signify the power of the Father,
and from them issues the sun” (they make themselves a
counterstroke to unity). “And from all the stars there
goes forth the power which is in every star, into the Deep,
and the power, heat and shining of the sun goes likewise
into the Deep”—back to the stars, into the power of the
Father. “And in the Deep the power of all stars, together
with the heat and lustre of the sun, are all but one thing,
a moving, boiling Hovering, like a spirit or matter. Now
in the whole deep of the Father, externally without the
Son, there is nothing but the manifold and unmeasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
or unsearchable power of the Father and the Light of the
Son. The Light of the Son is in the Deep of the Father a
living, all-powerful, all-knowing, all-hearing, all-seeing,
all-smelling, all-tasting, all-feeling Spirit, wherein is all
power, splendour, and wisdom, as in the Father and the
Son.”<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> That is Love, the softener of all powers through
the light of the Son. We see that the sensuous element
thus pertains to this.</p>

<p>Boehme really has the idea that “God’s essence” (which
has proceeded from the eternal deep as world) “is thus
not something far away which possesses a particular position
or place, for” essence, “the abyss of nature and
creation, is God Himself. Thou must not think that in
heaven there was some manner of <i>Corpus</i>”—the seven
spirits generate this <i>Corpus</i> or heart—“which above all
other things is called God. No; but the whole divine power
which itself is heaven and the heaven of all heavens, is so
generated, and that is called God the Father; of whom all
the holy angels are generated, in like manner also the
spirit of all men. Thou canst name no place, either in
heaven or in this world, where the divine birth is not.
The birth of the divine Trinity likewise takes place in
thine own heart; all three persons are generated in thy
heart, God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. In the divine
power everywhere we find the fountain spring of the
divine birth; and there already are all the seven qualifying
or fountain spirits of God, as if thou wouldst make
a spacious creaturely circumscribed circle and hadst the
deity therein.”<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In every spirit all are contained.</p>

<p>To Boehme this trinity is the complete universal life in
each individual, it is absolute substance. He says: “All
things in this world are according to the similitude of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ternary. Ye blind Jews, Turks, and Heathens, open
wide the eyes of your mind: I will show you, in your
body, and in every natural thing, in men, beasts, fowls,
and worms, also in wood, stone, leaves, and grass, the
likeness of the holy ternary in God. You say, there is
but one Being in God, and that God has no Son.
Open your eyes and consider your selves: man is made
according to the similitude and out of the power of God
in his ternary. Behold thy inward man, and then thou
wilt see it most plainly and clearly, if thou art not a fool
and an irrational beast. Therefore observe, in thy heart,
in thy veins, and in thy brain, thou hast thy spirit; and all
the powers which move in thy heart, in thy veins, and in thy
brain, wherein thy life consists, signify God the Father.
From that power springs up [gebaret] thy light, so that
thou seest, understandest, and knowest in the same power
what thou art to do; for that light glimmers in thy whole
body; and the whole body moves in the power and knowledge
of the light; this is the Son which is born in thee.”
This light, this seeing and understanding, is the second
determination; it is the relationship to itself. “Out of
thy light goes forth into the same power, reason, understanding,
skill, and wisdom, to govern the whole body,
and to distinguish all whatsoever is externally without the
body. And both these are but one in the government of
thy mind, viz. thy spirit, which signifies God the Holy
Ghost. And the Holy Ghost from God rules in this spirit
in thee, if thou art a child of light and not of darkness.
Now observe: in either wood, stone, or herbs there are
three things contained, neither can anything be generated
or grow, if but one of the three should be left out. First,
there is the power, from which a body comes to be, whether
wood, stone, or herbs; after that there is in that” thing
“a sap which is the heart of the thing. And thirdly there
is in it a springing, flowing power, smell, or taste, which
is the spirit of the thing whereby it grows and increases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Now if any of these three fail, the thing cannot subsist.”<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Thus Boehme regards everything as this ternary.</p>

<p>When he comes into particulars we see that he is obscure;
from his detailed explanations there is therefore not much
to be derived. As showing his manner of apprehending
natural things I shall give one more example of the manner
in which, in the further working out of the existence of
nature as a counterstroke to the divine knowledge, he makes
use of what we call things as Notions (<i>supra</i>, p. 192). The
creaturely, he says, has “three kinds of powers or <i>Spiritus</i>
in different <i>Centris</i>, but in one <i>Corpore</i>. (α) The first and
external <i>Spiritus</i> is the coarse sulphur, salt and <i>Mercurius</i>,
which is a substance of four elements” (fire, water, earth,
air) “or of the stars. It forms the visible <i>Corpus</i> according
to the constellation of the stars or property of the planets
and now enkindled elements—the greatest power of the
<i>Spiritus mundi</i>. The <i>Separator</i> makes the signature or
sign”—the self. The salt, the salitter, is approximately
the neutral: mercury [Merk or Mark] the operating, unrest
as against nourishment; the coarse sulphur, the negative
unity. (β) “The other <i>Spiritus</i> is found in the oil of
sulphur, the fifth essence, viz. a root of the four elements.
That is the softening and joy of the coarse, painful spirit of
sulphur and salt; the real cause of growing life, a joy of
nature as is the sun in the elements”—the direct principle
of life. “In the inward ground of that coarse spirit we see
a beautiful, clear <i>Corpus</i> in which the ideal light of nature
shines from the divine efflux.” The outward separator
signs what is taken up with the shape and form of the plant
which receives into itself this coarse nourishment. (γ)
“What comes third is the tincture, a spiritual fire and light;
the highest reason for which the first separation of qualities
takes place in the existence of this world. <i>Fiat</i> is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Word of each thing and belongs according to its peculiar
quality to eternity. Its origin is the holy power of God.
Smell [Ruch] is the sensation of this tincture. The elements
are only a mansion and counterstroke of the inward power,
a cause of the movement of the tincture.”<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Sensuous
things entirely lose the force of sensuous conceptions.
Boehme uses them, though not as such, as thought determinations,
that constitutes the hard and barbarous element
in Boehme’s representations, yet at the same time this unity
with actuality and this present of infinite existence.</p>

<p>Boehme describes the opposition in creation in the following
way. If nature is the first efflux of the <i>Separator</i>, two
kinds of life must yet be understood as in the counterstroke
of the divine essence, beyond that temporal one there is
an eternal, to which the divine understanding is given. It
stands at the basis of the eternal, spiritual world, in the
<i>Mysterium Magnum</i> of the divine counterstroke (personality)—a
mansion of divine will through which it reveals
itself and is revealed to no peculiarity of personal will.
In this <i>centrum</i> man has both lives in himself, he belongs
to time and eternity. He is (α) universal in the “eternal
understanding of the one good will which is a temperament;
(β) the original will of nature, viz. the comprehensibility
of the <i>Centra</i>, where each <i>centrum</i> in the divisibility
shuts itself in one place to egotism and self-will as a personal
<i>Mysterium</i> or mind. The former only requires a
counterstroke to its similarity; this latter, the self-generated
natural will also requires in the place of the egotism of the
dark impression a likeness, that is a counterstroke through
its own comprehensibility, through which comprehension
it requires nothing but its corporality as a natural ground.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Now it is this “I,” the dark, pain, fire, the wrath of God,
implicitude, self-comprehension, which is broken up in
regeneration; the I is shattered, painfulness brought into
true rest—just as the dark fire breaks into light.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Now these are the principal ideas found in Boehme;
those most profound are (α) the generating of Light as the
Son of God from qualities, through the most living
dialectic; (β) God’s diremption of Himself. Barbarism in
the working out of his system can no more fail to be recognized
than can the great depths into which he has plunged
by the union of the most absolute opposites. Boehme
grasps the opposites in the crudest, harshest way, but he
does not allow himself through their unworkableness to be
prevented from asserting the unity. This rude and
barbarous depth which is devoid of Notion, is always a
present, something which speaks from itself, which has and
knows everything in itself. We have still to mention
Boehme’s piety, the element of edification, the way in
which the soul is guided in his writings. This is in the
highest degree deep and inward, and if one is familiar with
his form these depths and this inwardness will be found. But
it is a form with which we cannot reconcile ourselves, and
which permits no definite conception of details, although
we cannot fail to see the profound craving for speculation
which existed within this man.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge" id="c217">SECTION TWO</p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">Period of the Thinking Understanding</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">After</span> Neo-Platonism and all that is associated with it is
left behind, it is not until Descartes is arrived at that we
really enter upon a philosophy which is, properly speaking,
independent, which knows that it comes forth from reason
as independent, and that self-consciousness is an essential
moment in the truth. Philosophy in its own proper soil
separates itself entirely from the philosophizing theology,
in accordance with its principle, and places it on quite
another side. Here, we may say, we are at home, and like
the mariner after a long voyage in a tempestuous sea, we
may now hail the sight of land; with Descartes the
culture of modern times, the thought of modern Philosophy,
really begins to appear, after a long and tedious journey on
the way which has led so far. It is specially characteristic
of the German that the more servile he on the one hand is,
the more uncontrolled is he on the other; restraint and
want of restraint—originality, is the angel of darkness that
buffets us. In this new period the universal principle
by means of which everything in the world is regulated,
is the thought that proceeds from itself; it is a certain
inwardness, which is above all evidenced in respect to
Christianity, and which is the Protestant principle in
accordance with which thought has come to the consciousness
of the world at large as that to which every man has
a claim. Thus because the independently existent thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
this culminating point of inwardness, is now set forth and
firmly grasped as such, the dead externality of authority
is set aside and regarded as out of place. It is only
through my own free thought within that thought can
however be recognized and ratified by me. This likewise
signifies that such free thought is the universal business of
the world and of individuals; it is indeed the duty of every
man, since everything is based upon it; thus what claims
to rank as established in the world man must scrutinize in
his own thoughts. Philosophy is thus become a matter of
universal interest, and one respecting which each can
judge for himself; for everyone is a thinker from the
beginning.</p>

<p>On account of this new beginning to Philosophy we find
in the old histories of Philosophy of the seventeenth century—<i>e.g.</i>
that of Stanley—the philosophy of the Greeks
and Romans only, and Christianity forms the conclusion.
The idea was that neither in Christianity nor subsequently
any philosophy was to be found, because there was no
longer a necessity for it, seeing that the philosophic theology
of the Middle Ages had not free, spontaneous thought
as its principle (Vol. I. pp. 111, 112). But though it is true
that this has now become the philosophic principle, we
must not expect that it should be at once methodically
developed out of thought. The old assumption is made,
that man only attains to the truth through reflection;
this plainly is the principle. But the determination and
definition of God, the world of the manifold as it appears,
is not yet revealed as necessarily proceeding from thought;
for we have only reached the thought of a content which
is given through ordinary conception, observation, and
experience.</p>

<p>On the one hand we see a metaphysic, and, on the other,
the particular sciences: on the one hand abstract thought
as such, on the other its content taken from experience;
these two lines in the abstract stand opposed to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
another, and yet they do not separate themselves so sharply.
We shall indeed come to an opposition, viz. to that between
<i>a priori</i> thought—that the determinations which are to hold
good for thought must be taken from thought itself—and
the determination that we must commence, conclude and
think from experience. This is the opposition between
rationalism and empiricism; but it is really a subordinate
one, because even the metaphysical mode in philosophy,
which only allows validity to immanent thought, does not
take what is methodically developed from the necessity of
thought, but in the old way derives its content from inward
or outward experience, and through reflection and
meditation renders it abstract. The form of philosophy
which is first reached through thought is metaphysics, the
form of the thinking understanding; this period has, as
its outstanding figures, Descartes and Spinoza, likewise
Malebranche and Locke, Leibnitz and Wolff. The second
form is Scepticism and Criticism with regard to the thinking
understanding, to metaphysics as such, and to the
universal of empiricism; here we shall go on to speak
of representatives of the Scottish, German, and French
philosophies; the French materialists again turn back to
metaphysics.</p>

<span class="head smcap">The Metaphysics of the Understanding</span></h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">Metaphysics</span> is what reaches after substance, and this implies
that one unity, one thought is maintained in opposition
to dualism, just as Being was amongst the ancients. In
metaphysics itself we have, however, the opposition between
substantiality and individuality. What comes first is the
spontaneous, but likewise uncritical, metaphysics, and it is
represented by Descartes and Spinoza, who assert the unity
of Being and thought. The second stage is found in
Locke, who treats of the opposition itself inasmuch as he
considers the metaphysical Idea of experience, that is the
origin of thoughts and their justification, not yet entering
on the question of whether they are absolutely true. In
the third place we have Leibnitz’s monad—the world
viewed as a totality.</p>

<p>We here encounter the innate ideas of Descartes. The
philosophy of Spinoza, in the second place, is related to
the philosophy of Descartes as its necessary development
only; the method is an important part of it. A method
which stands alongside of Spinozism and which is also a
perfected development of Cartesianism, is, in the third
place, that by which Malebranche has represented this
philosophy.</p>

<h3><a id="c220c">1. <span class="smcap">Descartes.</span></a></h3>

<p>René Descartes is a bold spirit who re-commenced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
whole subject from the very beginning and constituted
afresh the ground-work on which Philosophy is based,
and to which, after a thousand years had passed, it
once more returned. The extent of the influence which
this man exercised upon his times and the culture of
Philosophy generally, cannot be sufficiently expressed; it
rests mainly in his setting aside all former presuppositions
and beginning in a free, simple, and likewise popular way,
with popular modes of thought and quite simple propositions,
in his leading the content to thought and extension
or Being, and so to speak setting up this before thought as
its opposite. This simple thought appeared in the form of
the determinate, clear understanding, and it cannot thus be
called speculative thought or speculative reason. There
are fixed determinations from which Descartes proceeds,
but only of thought; this is the method of his time. What
the French called exact science, science of the determinate
understanding, made its appearance at this time. Philosophy
and exact science were not yet separated, and it was
only later on that this separation first took place.</p>

<p>To come to the life of Descartes—he was born in 1596,
at La Haye in Touraine, of an ancient and noble race.
He received an education of the usual kind in a Jesuit
school, and made great progress; his disposition was lively
and restless; he extended his insatiable zeal in all directions,
pursued his researches into all systems and forms;
his studies, in addition to ancient literature, embraced such
subjects as philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, physics, and
astronomy. But the studies of his youth in the Jesuit
school, and those studies which he afterwards prosecuted
with the same diligence and strenuous zeal, resulted in
giving him a strong disinclination for learning derived
from books; he quitted the school where he had been
educated, and yet his eagerness for learning was only
made the keener through this perplexity and unsatisfied
yearning. He went as a young man of eighteen to Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and there lived in the great world. But as he here found
no satisfaction, he soon left society and returned to his
studies. He retired to a suburb of Paris and there
occupied himself principally with mathematics, remaining
quite concealed from all his former friends. At
last, after the lapse of two years, he was discovered by
them, drawn forth from his retirement, and again introduced
to the great world. He now once more renounced
the study of books and threw himself into the affairs of
actual life. Thereafter he went to Holland and entered
the military service; soon afterwards, in 1619, and in the
first year of the Thirty Years’ War, he went as a volunteer
with the Bavarian troops, and took part in several
campaigns under Tilly. Many have found learning unsatisfying;
Descartes became a soldier—not because he
found in the sciences too little, but because they were too
much, too high for him. Here in his winter quarters he
studied diligently, and in Ulm, for instance, he made
acquaintance with a citizen who was deeply versed in
mathematics. He was able to carry out his studies even
better in winter quarters at Neuberg on the Danube, where
once more, and now most profoundly, the desire awoke in
him to strike out a new departure in Philosophy and
entirely reconstruct it; he solemnly promised the Mother
of God to make a pilgrimage to Loretto if she would
prosper him in this design, and if he should now at last
come to himself and attain to peace. He was also in the
battle at Prague in which Frederick the Elector-Palatine
lost the Bohemian crown. Yet since the sight of these
wild scenes could not satisfy him, he gave up military
service in 1621. He made several other journeys through
the rest of Germany, and then proceeded to Poland,
Prussia, Switzerland, Italy and France. On account of its
greater freedom he withdrew to Holland, in order there to
pursue his projects; here he lived in peace from 1629 to
1644—a period in which he composed and issued most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
his works, and also defended them against the manifold
attacks from which they suffered, and which more especially
proceeded from the clergy. Queen Christina of
Sweden finally called him to her court at Stockholm, which
was the rendezvous for all the most celebrated men of
learning of the time, and there he died in 1650.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>As regards his philosophic works, those which contain
his first principles have in particular something very
popular about their method of presentation, which makes
them highly to be recommended to those commencing the
study of philosophy. Descartes sets to work in a quite
simple and childlike manner, with a narration of his reflections
as they came to him. Professor Cousin of Paris
has brought out a new edition of Descartes in eleven octavo
volumes; the greater part consists of letters on natural
phenomena. Descartes gave a new impetus to mathematics
as well as to philosophy. Several important methods
were discovered by him, upon which the most brilliant
results in higher mathematics were afterwards built. His
method is even now an essential in mathematics, for
Descartes is the inventor of analytic geometry, and consequently
the first to point out the way in this field of
science to modern mathematics. He likewise cultivated
physics, optics, and astronomy, and made the most important
discoveries in these; we have not, however, to
deal with such matters. The application of metaphysics
to ecclesiastical affairs, investigations, etc., has likewise no
special interest for us.</p>

<p>1. In Philosophy Descartes struck out quite original
lines; with him the new epoch in Philosophy begins,
whereby it was permitted to culture to grasp in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of universality the principle of its higher spirit in
thought, just as Boehme grasped it in sensuous perceptions
and forms. Descartes started by saying that
thought must necessarily commence from itself; all the
philosophy which came before this, and specially what
proceeded from the authority of the Church, was for
ever after set aside. But since here thought has properly
speaking grasped itself as abstract understanding only, in
relation to which the more concrete content still stands
over on the other side, the determinate conceptions were
not yet deduced from the understanding, but taken up only
empirically. In Descartes’ philosophy we have thus to
distinguish what has, and what has not universal interest
for us: the former is the process of his thoughts themselves,
and the latter the mode in which these thoughts
are presented and deduced. Yet we must not consider the
process as a method of consistent proof; it is indeed a
deep and inward progress, but it comes to us in an ingenuous
and naïve form. In order to do justice to Descartes’
thoughts it is necessary for us to be assured of the necessity
for his appearance; the spirit of his philosophy is simply
knowledge as the unity of Thought and Being. And yet
on the whole there is little to say about his philosophy.</p>

<p>a. Descartes expresses the fact that we must begin from
thought as such alone, by saying that we must doubt
everything (<i>De omnibus dubitandum est</i>); and that is an
absolute beginning. He thus makes the abolition of all
determinations the first condition of Philosophy. This first
proposition has not, however, the same signification as
Scepticism, which sets before it no other aim than doubt
itself, and requires that we should remain in this indecision
of mind, an indecision wherein mind finds its
freedom. It rather signifies that we should renounce all
prepossessions—that is, all hypotheses which are accepted
as true in their immediacy—and commence from thought,
so that from it we should in the first place attain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
some fixed and settled basis, and make a true beginning.
In Scepticism this is not the case, for with the sceptics
doubt is the end at which they rest.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> But the doubting
of Descartes, his making no hypotheses, because nothing
is fixed or secure, does not occur in the interests of freedom
as such, in order that nothing should have value except
freedom itself, and nothing exist in the quality of an
external objective. To him everything is unstable indeed,
in so far as the Ego can abstract from it or can think, for
pure thought is abstraction from everything. But in
consciousness the end is predominant, and it is to arrive at
something fixed and objective—and not the moment of subjectivity,
or the fact of being set forth, known and proved
by me. Yet this last comes along with the other, for it is
from the starting point of my thought that I would attain
my object; the impulse of freedom is thus likewise
fundamental.</p>

<p>In the propositions in which Descartes gives in his own
way the ground of this great and most important principle,
there is found a naïve and empirical system of reasoning.
This is an example: “Because we were born as children,
and formed all manner of judgments respecting sensuous
things before we had the perfect use of our reason, we are
through many preconceived ideas hindered from the knowledge
of the truth. From these we appear not to be able
to free ourselves in any other way but by once in our
lives striving to doubt that respecting which we have the
very slightest suspicion of an uncertainty. Indeed it is
really desirable to hold as false everything in respect to
which we have any doubt, so that we may find more clearly
what is most certain and most knowable. Yet this doubt
has to be limited to the contemplation of the truth, for in
the conduct of our life we are compelled to choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
probable, since there the opportunity for action would often
pass away before we could solve our doubts. But here,
where we have only to deal with the search for truth, we
may very reasonably doubt whether any thing sensuous and
perceptible exists—in the first place because we find that the
senses often deceive us and it is prudent not to trust in
what has even once deceived us, and then because every day
in dreaming we think we feel or see before ourselves innumerable
things which never were, and to the doubter no
signs are given by which he can safely distinguish sleeping
from waking. We shall hereby likewise doubt everything
else, even mathematical propositions, partly because we
have seen that some err even in what we hold most certain,
and ascribe value to what to us seems false, and partly
because we have heard that a God exists who has created
us, and who can do everything, so that He may have created
us liable to err. But if we conceive ourselves not to derive
our existence from God, but from some other source, perhaps
from ourselves, we are all the more liable, in that we
are thus imperfect, to err. But we have so far the experience
of freedom within us that we can always refrain
from what is not perfectly certain and well founded.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
The demand which rests at the basis of Descartes’ reasonings
thus is that what is recognized as true should be able
to maintain the position of having the thought therein at
home with itself. The so-called immediate intuition and
inward revelation, which in modern times is so highly
regarded, has its place here. But because in the Cartesian
form the principle of freedom as such is not brought into
view, the grounds which are here advanced are for the
most part popular.</p>

<p>b. Descartes sought something in itself certain and true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which should neither be only true like the object of faith
without knowledge, nor the sensuous and also sceptical
certainty which is without truth. The whole of Philosophy
as it had been carried on up to this time was vitiated by
the constant presupposition of something as true, and in
some measure, as in the Neo-Platonic philosophy, by not
giving the form of scientific knowledge to its matter, or by
not separating its moments. But to Descartes nothing is
true which does not possess an inward evidence in consciousness,
or which reason does not recognize so clearly
and conclusively that any doubt regarding it is absolutely
impossible. “Because we thus reject or declare to be false
everything regarding which we can have any doubt at all,
it is easy for us to suppose that there is no God, no heaven,
no body—but we cannot therefore say that we do not exist,
who think this. For it is contradictory to say that what
thinks does not exist. Hence the knowledge that ‘I think,
therefore I am,’ is what we arrive at first of all, and it is
the most certain fact that offers itself to everyone who
follows after philosophy in an orderly fashion. This is the
best way of becoming acquainted with the nature of spirit
and its diversity from body. For if we inquire who we are
who can set forth as untrue everything which is different
from ourselves, we clearly see that no extension, figure,
change of position, nor any such thing which can be
ascribed to body, constitutes our nature, but only thought
alone; which is thus known earlier and more certainly than
any corporeal thing.”<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> ‘I’ has thus significance here as
thought, and not as individuality of self-consciousness.
The second proposition of the Cartesian philosophy is hence
the immediate certainty of thought. Certainty is only
knowledge as such in its pure form as self-relating, and
this is thought; thus then the unwieldy understanding
makes its way on to the necessity of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Descartes begins, just as Fichte did later on, with the
‘I’ as indubitably certain; I know that something is presented
in me. By this Philosophy is at one stroke transplanted
to quite another field and to quite another standpoint,
namely to the sphere of subjectivity. Presuppositions
in religion are given up; proof alone is sought for, and
not the absolute content which disappears before abstract
infinite subjectivity. There is in Descartes likewise a
seething desire to speak from strong feeling, from the
ordinary sensuous point of view, just as Bruno and so many
others, each in his own fashion, express as individualities
their particular conceptions of the world. To consider the
content in itself is not the first matter; for I can abstract
from all my conceptions, but not from the ‘I.’ We think
this and that, and hence it is—is to give the common would-be-wise
argument of those incapable of grasping the matter
in point; that a determinate content exists is exactly what
we are forced to doubt—there is nothing absolutely fixed.
Thought is the entirely universal, but not merely because
I can abstract, but because ‘I’ is thus simple, self-identical.
Thought consequently comes first; the next determination
arrived at, in direct connection with it, is the determination
of Being. The ‘I think’ directly involves my
Being; this, says Descartes, is the absolute basis of all
Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The determination of Being is in my ‘I’;
this connection is itself the first matter. Thought as
Being and Being as thought—that is my certainty, ‘I’;
in the celebrated <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i> we thus have Thought
and Being inseparably bound together.</p>

<p>On the one hand this proposition is regarded as a syllogism:
from thought Being is deduced. Kant more
especially has objected to this that Being is not contained
in thinking, that it is different from thinking. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
true, but they are still inseparable, or constitute an identity;
their difference is not to the prejudice of their unity. Yet
this maxim of pure abstract certainty, the universal totality
in which everything implicitly exists, is not proved;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> we
must therefore not try to convert this proposition into a
syllogism. Descartes himself says: “There is no syllogism
present at all. For in order that there should be
such, the major premise must have been ‘all that thinks
exists’”—from which the subsumption would have followed
in the minor premise, ‘now I am.’ By this the immediacy
which rests in the proposition, would be removed. “But
that major premise” is not set forth at all, being “really
in the first instance derived from the original ‘I think,
therefore, I am.’”<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> For arriving at a conclusion three links
are required—in this case we ought to have a third through
which thought and Being should have been mediated,
and it is not to be found here. The ‘Therefore’ which
binds the two sides together is not the ‘Therefore’ of a
syllogism; the connection between Being and Thought is
only immediately posited. This certainty is thus the
<i>prius</i>; all other propositions come later. The thinking
subject as the simple immediacy of being-at-home-with-me
is the very same thing as what is called Being; and it is
quite easy to perceive this identity. As universal, thought
is contained in all that is particular, and thus is pure relation
to itself, pure oneness with itself. We must not make
the mistake of representing Being to ourselves as a concrete
content, and hence it is the same immediate identity which
thought likewise is. Immediacy is, however, a one-sided
determination; thought does not contain it alone, but also
the determination to mediate itself with itself, and thereby—by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the mediation being at the same time the abrogation
of the mediation—it is immediacy. In thought we thus
have Being; Being is, however, a poor determination, it
is the abstraction from the concrete of thought. This
identity of Being and Thought, which constitutes the most
interesting idea of modern times, has not been further
worked out by Descartes; he has relied on consciousness
alone, and for the time being placed it in the fore-front.
For with Descartes the necessity to develop the differences
from the ‘I think’ is not yet present; Fichte first
applied himself to the deduction of all determinations from
this culminating point of absolute certainty.</p>

<p>Other propositions have been set against that of
Descartes. Gassendi,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> for example, asks if we might not
just as well say <i>Ludificor, ergo sum</i>: I am made a fool of
by my consciousness, therefore I exist—or properly speaking,
therefore I am made a fool of. Descartes himself
recognized that this objection merited consideration, but
he here repels it, inasmuch as it is the ‘I’ alone and
not the other content which has to be maintained. Being
alone is identical with pure thought, and not its content,
be it what it may. Descartes further says: “By thought
I, however, understand all that takes place in us within
our consciousness, in as far as we are conscious of it;
thus will, conception, and even feeling are identical with
thought. For if I say ‘I see,’ or ‘I walk out,’ and ‘therefore
I am,’ and understand by this the seeing and walking
which is accomplished by the body, the conclusion is not
absolutely certain, because, as often happens in a dream,
I may imagine that I can see or walk even if I do not
open my eyes nor move from my place, and I might also
possibly do so supposing I had no body. But if I understand
it of the subjective feeling or the consciousness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
seeing or walking itself, because it is then related to the
mind that alone feels or thinks that it sees or walks, this
conclusion is perfectly certain.”<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> “In a dream” is an
empirical mode of reasoning, but there is no other objection
to it. In willing, seeing, hearing, &amp;c., thought is likewise
contained, it is absurd to suppose that the soul has thinking
in one special pocket, and seeing, willing, &amp;c., in others.
But if I say ‘I see,’ ‘I walk out,’ there is present on the one
hand my consciousness ‘I,’ and consequently thought, on
the other hand, however, there is present willing, seeing,
hearing, walking, and thus a still further modification of
the content. Now because of this modification I cannot
say ‘I walk, and therefore I am,’ for I can undoubtedly
abstract from the modification, since it is no longer
universal Thought. Thus we must merely look at the pure
consciousness contained in the concrete ‘I.’ Only when
I accentuate the fact that I am present there as thinking,
is pure Being implied, for only with the universal is
Being united.</p>

<p>“In this it is implied,” says Descartes, “that thought is
more certain to me than body. If from the fact that I
touch or see the earth I judge that it exists, I must more
certainly judge from this that my thought exists. For it may
very well happen that I judge the earth to exist, even if it
does not exist, but it cannot be that I judge this, and that my
mind which judges this does not exist.”<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> That is to say,
everything which is for me I may assert to be non-existent,
but when I assert myself to be non-existent, I myself
<i>assert</i>, or it is <i>my</i> judgment. For I cannot set aside the
fact that I judge, even if I can abstract from that respecting
which I judge. In this Philosophy has regained its own
ground that thought starts from thought as what is certain
in itself, and not from something external, not from something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
given, not from an authority, but directly from the
freedom that is contained in the ‘I think.’ Of all
else I may doubt, of the existence of bodily things,
of my body itself; or this certainty does not possess
immediacy in itself. For ‘I’ is just certainty itself,
but in all else this certainty is only predicate; my
body is certain to <i>me</i>, it is not this certainty itself.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
As against the certainty we feel of having a body,
Descartes adduces the empirical phenomenon that we often
hear of persons imagining they feel pain in a limb which
they have lost long ago.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> What is actual, he says is a
substance, the soul is a thinking substance; it is thus for
itself, separate from all external material things and
independent. That it is thinking is evident from its
nature: it would think and exist even if no material things
were present; the soul can hence know itself more easily
than its body.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>All else that we can hold as true rests on this certainty;
for in order that anything should be held as true, evidence
is requisite, but nothing is true which has not this inward
evidence in consciousness. “Now the evidence of everything
rests upon our perceiving it as clearly and vividly as
that certainty itself, and on its so entirely depending from,
and harmonizing with this principle, that if we wished to
doubt it we should also have to doubt this principle likewise”
(our <i>ego</i>).<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> This knowledge is indeed on its own account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
perfect evidence, but it is not yet the truth, or if we take
that Being as truth, it is an empty content, and it is with
the content that we have to do.</p>

<p>c. What comes third is thus the transition of this
certainty into truth, into the determinate; Descartes again
makes this transition in a naïve way, and with it we for the
first time begin to consider his metaphysics. What here
takes place is that an interest arises in further representations
and conceptions of the abstract unity of Being
and Thought; there Descartes sets to work in an externally
reflective manner. “The consciousness which merely
knows itself to be certain now however seeks to extend its
knowledge, and finds that it has conceptions of many
things—in which conceptions it does not deceive itself, so
long as it does not assert or deny that something similar
outside corresponds to them.” Deception in the conceptions
has meaning only in relation to external existence.
“Consciousness also discovers universal conceptions, and
obtains from them proofs which are evident, <i>e.g.</i> the geometric
proposition that the three angles of a triangle are
together equal to two right angles is a conception which
follows incontrovertibly from others. But in reflecting
whether such things really exist doubts arise.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> That
there is such a thing as a triangle is indeed in this case by
no means certain, since extension is not contained in the
immediate certainty of myself. The soul may exist without
the bodily element, and this last without it, they are
in reality different; one is conceivable without the other.
The soul thus does not think and know the other as clearly
as the certainty of itself.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Now the truth of all knowledge rests on the proof of
the existence of God. The soul is an imperfect substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but it has the Idea of an absolute perfect existence
within itself; this perfection is not begotten in itself,
just because it is an imperfect substance; this Idea
is thus innate. In Descartes the consciousness of this
fact is expressed by his saying that as long as the existence
of God is not proved and perceived the possibility of
our deceiving ourselves remains, because we cannot know
whether we do not possess a nature ordered and disposed
to err (<i>supra</i>, p. 226).<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The form is rather a mistaken one,
and it only generally expresses the opposition in which
self-consciousness stands to the consciousness of what is
different, of the objective; and we have to deal with the
unity of both—the question being whether what is in
thought likewise possesses objectivity. This unity rests in
God, or is God Himself. I shall put these assertions in
the manner of Descartes: “Amongst these various conceptions
possessed by us there likewise is the conception
of a supremely intelligent, powerful, and absolutely perfect
Being; and this is the most excellent of all conceptions.”
This all-embracing universal conception has therefore this
distinguishing feature, that in its case the uncertainty
respecting Being which appears in the other conceptions,
finds no place. It has the characteristic that “In it we do
not recognize existence as something merely possible and
accidental, as we do the conceptions of other things which
we perceive clearly, but as a really essential and eternal determination.
For instance, as mind perceives that in the
conception of a triangle it is implied that the three angles are
equal to two right angles, the triangle has them; and in
the same way from the fact that mind perceives existence
to be necessarily and eternally implied in the Notion of the
most perfect reality, it is forced to conclude that the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
perfect reality exists.”<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> For to perfection there likewise
pertains the determination of existence, since the conception
of a non-existent is less perfect. Thus we there
have the unity of thought and Being, and the ontological
proof of the existence of God; this we met with earlier
(p. 63, <i>seq.</i>) in dealing with Anselm.</p>

<p>The proof of the existence of God from the Idea of Him
is in this wise: In this Notion existence is implied; and
therefore it is true. Descartes proceeds further in the same
direction, in so far as after the manner of empirical axioms
he sets forth: (α) “There are different degrees of reality or
entity, for the substance has more reality than the accident
or the mode, and infinite substance has more than finite.”
(β) “In the Notion of a thing existence is implied, either
the merely potential or the necessary,” <i>i.e.</i> in the ‘I’ there
is Being as the immediate certainty of an other-being, of
the not-I opposed to the I. (γ) “No thing or no perfection
of a thing which really exists <i>actu</i> can have the Nothing as
original cause of its existence. For if anything could be
predicated of nothing, thought could equally well be predicated
of it, and I would thus say that I am nothing because
I think.” Descartes here arrives at a dividing line, at an
unknown relationship; the Notion of cause is reached, and
this is a thought indeed, but a determinate thought.
Spinoza says in his explanation, “That the conceptions
contain more or less reality, and those moments have just
as much evidence as thought itself, because they not only
say that we think, but how we think.” These determinate
modes as differences in the simplicity of thought, had, however,
to be demonstrated. Spinoza adds to this step in
advance that “The degrees of reality which we perceive in
ideas are not in the ideas in as far as they are considered
merely as kinds of thought, but in so far as the one represents
a substance and the other a mere mode of substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
or, in a word, in so far as they are considered as conceptions
of things.” (δ) “The objective reality of Notions” (<i>i.e.</i>,
the entity of what is represented in so far as it is in the
Notion), “demands a first cause in which the same reality
is contained not merely objectively” (that is to say in the
Notion), “but likewise formally or even <i>eminenter</i>—formally,
that is perfectly likewise: <i>eminenter</i>, more perfectly.
For there must at least be as much in the cause as in the
effect.” (ε) “The existence of God is known immediately”—<i>a
priori</i>—“from the contemplation of His nature. To
say that anything is contained in the nature or in the
Notion of a thing is tantamount to saying that it is true:
existence is directly contained in the Notion of God. Hence
it is quite true to say of Him that existence pertains of
necessity to Him. There is implied in the Notion of every
particular thing either a possible or a necessary existence—a
necessary existence in the Notion of God, <i>i.e.</i> of the
absolutely perfect Being, for else He would be conceived
as imperfect.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Descartes likewise argues after this manner: “Problem:
to prove <i>a posteriori</i> from the mere Notion within us the
existence of God. The objective reality of a Notion demands
a cause in which the same reality is not merely contained
objectively” (as in the finite), “but formally” (freely,
purely for itself, outside of us) “or <i>eminenter</i>” (as original).
(Axiom δ.) “We now have a Notion of God, but His objective
reality is neither formally nor <i>eminenter</i> contained
within us, and it can thus be only in God Himself.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Consequently
we see that with Descartes this Idea is an
hypothesis. Now we should say we find this highest Idea
in us. If we then ask whether this Idea exists, why, this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the Idea, that existence is asserted with it. To say that it
is only a conception is to contradict the meaning of this
conception. But here it is unsatisfactory to find that the
conception is introduced thus: ‘We have this conception,’
and to find that it consequently appears like an hypothesis.
In such a case it is not proved of this content in itself that
it determines itself into this unity of thought and Being.
In the form of God no other conception is thus here given
than that contained in <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>, wherein Being and
thought are inseparably bound up—though now in the form
of a conception which I possess within me. The whole
content of this conception, the Almighty, All-wise, &amp;c., are
predicates which do not make their appearance until later;
the content is simply the content of the Idea bound up with
existence. Hence we see these determinations following
one another in an empirical manner, and not philosophically
proved—thus giving us an example of how in <i>a priori</i>
metaphysics generally hypotheses of conceptions are brought
in, and these become objects of thought, just as happens in empiricism
with investigations, observations, and experiences.</p>

<p>Descartes then proceeds: “Mind is the more convinced
of this when it notices that it discovers within itself the
conception of no other thing wherein existence is necessarily
implied. From this it will perceive that that idea of
highest reality is not imagined by it, it is not chimerical, but
a true and unalterable fact which cannot do otherwise than
exist, seeing that existence is necessarily involved in it.
Our prejudices hinder us from apprehending this with ease,
for we are accustomed to distinguish in all other things the
essence” (the Notion) “from the existence.” Respecting
the assertion that thought is not inseparable from existence,
the common way of talking is as follows: ‘If what men
think really existed, things would be different.’ But in
saying this men do not take into account that what is
spoken of in this way is always a particular content, and
that in it the essential nature of the finality of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
simply signifies the fact that Notion and Being are separable.
But how can one argue from finite things to the
infinite? “This Notion,” Descartes continues, “is furthermore
not made by us.” It is now declared to be an eternal
truth which is revealed in us. “We do not find in ourselves
the perfections which are contained in this conception.
Thus we are certain that a first cause in which is all perfection,
<i>i.e.</i> God as really existent, has given them to us; for
it is certain to us that from nothing, nothing arises”
(according to Boehme God derived the material of the
world from Himself), “and what is perfect cannot be the
effect of anything imperfect. From Him we must thus in
true science deduce all created things.”<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> With the proof
of the existence of God the validity of and evidence for all
truth in its origin is immediately established. God as First
Cause is Being-for-self, the reality which is not merely
entity or existence in thought. An existence such as this
first cause (which is not what we know as a thing) rests in
the Notion of the not-I, not of each determinate thing—since
these as determinate are negations—but only in the
Notion of pure existence or the perfect cause. It is the
cause of the truth of ideas, for the aspect that it represents
is that of their Being.</p>

<p>d. Fourthly, Descartes goes on to assert: “We must
believe what is revealed to us by God, though we cannot
understand it. It is not to be wondered at, since we are
finite, that there is in God’s nature as inconceivably infinite,
what passes our comprehension.” This represents the
entrance of a very ordinary conception. Boehme on the
other hand says (<i>supra</i>, p. 212): ‘The mystery of the Trinity
is ever born within us.’ Descartes, however, concludes:
“Hence we must not trouble ourselves with investigations
respecting the infinite; for seeing that we are finite, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
absurd for us to say anything about it.”<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> This matter we
shall not, however, enter upon at present.</p>

<p>“Now the first attribute of God is that He is true
and the Giver of all light; it is hence quite contrary to
His nature to deceive us. Hence the light of nature
or the power of acquiring knowledge given us by God can
affect no object which is not really true in as far as
it is affected by it” (the power of acquiring knowledge)
“<i>i.e.</i> as it is perceived clearly and distinctly.” We ascribe
truth to God. From this Descartes goes on to infer the
universal bond which exists between absolute knowledge
and the objectivity of what we thus know. Knowledge has
objects, has a content which is known; we call this connection
truth. The truth of God is just this unity of what
is thought by the subject or clearly perceived, and external
reality or existence. “Thereby an end is put to doubt, as
if it could be the case that what appears quite evident to
us should not be really true. We can thus no longer have
any suspicion of mathematical truths. Likewise if we give
heed to what we distinguish by our senses in waking or in
sleeping, clearly and distinctly, it is easy to recognize in
each thing what in it is true.” By saying that what is
rightly and clearly thought likewise is, Descartes maintains
that man comes to know by means of thought what in fact
is in things; the sources of errors lie on the other hand in
the finitude of our nature. “It is certain, because of God’s
truth, that the faculty of perceiving and that of assenting
through the will, if it extends no further than to that
which is clearly perceived, cannot lead to error. Even if this
cannot be in any way proved, it is by nature so established
in all things, that as often as we clearly perceive anything,
we assent to it from ourselves and can in no wise doubt
that it is true.”<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is set forth very plausibly, but it is still indeterminate,
formal, and shallow; we only have the assertion
made to us that this is so. Descartes’ method is the
method of the clear understanding merely. Certainty with
him takes the first place; from it no content is deduced of
necessity, no content generally, and still less its objectivity
as distinguished from the inward subjectivity of the ‘I.’
At one time we have the opposition of subjective knowledge
and actuality, and at another their inseparable union.
In the first case the necessity of mediating them enters in,
and the truth of God is asserted to be this mediating power.
It consists in this, that His Notion contains reality immediately
in itself. The proof of this unity then rests solely
upon the fact of its being said that we find within us the
idea of complete perfection; thus this conception here
appears simply as one found ready to hand. With this
is compared the mere conception of God which contains
no existence within it, and it is found that without existence
it would be imperfect. This unity of God Himself,
of His Idea, with His existence, is undoubtedly the Truth;
in this we find the ground for holding as true what is for
us just as certain as the truth of ourselves. As Descartes
proceeds further we thus find that in reality everything
has truth for him only in so far as it is really an object of
thought, a universal. This truth of God has been, as we
shall see, expressed even more clearly and in a more concise
way by a disciple of Descartes, if one may venture
to call him so—I mean Malebranche (who might really be
dealt with here),<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> in his <i>Recherche de la vérité</i>.</p>

<p>The first of the fundamental determinations of the
Cartesian metaphysics is from the certainty of oneself to
arrive at the truth, to recognize Being in the Notion of
thought. But because in the thought “I think,” I am an
individual, thought comes before my mind as subjective;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Being is hence not demonstrated in the Notion of thought
itself, for what advance has been made is merely in the
direction of separation generally. In the second place the
negative of Being likewise comes before self-consciousness,
and this negative, united with the positive I, is so to speak
implicitly united in a third, in God. God, who before this
was a non-contradictory potentiality, now takes objective
form to self-consciousness, He is all reality in so far as it
is positive, <i>i.e.</i> as it is Being, unity of thought and Being,
the highest perfection of existence; it is just in the negative,
in the Notion of this, in its being an object of thought, that
Being is contained. An objection to this identity is now
old—Kant urged it likewise—that from the Notion of the
most perfect existence more does not follow than that <i>in</i>
thought existence here and now and the most perfect
essence are conjoined, but not <i>outside</i> of thought. But the
very Notion of present existence is this negative of self-consciousness,
not out of thought,—but the thought of
the ‘out of thought.’</p>

<p>2. Descartes accepts Being in the entirely positive sense,
and has not the conception of its being the negative of self-consciousness:
but simple Being, set forth as the negative of
self-consciousness, is extension. Descartes thus separates
extension from God, remains constant to this separation,
unites the universe, matter, with God in such a way as to
make Him its creator and first cause: and he has the true
perception that conservation is a continuous creation, in so far
as creation as activity is asserted to be separated. Descartes
does not, however, trace extension in a true method back to
thought; matter, extended substances, stand over against
the thinking substances which are simple; in as far as the
universe is created by God, it could not be as perfect as its
cause. As a matter of fact the effect is less perfect than
the cause, since it is that which is posited, if we are to remain
at the conception of cause pertaining to the understanding.
Hence according to Descartes extension is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
less perfect. But as imperfect the extended substances
cannot exist and subsist through themselves or their Notion;
they thus require every moment the assistance of God for
their maintenance, and without this they would in a moment
sink back into nothing. Preservation is, however,
unceasing reproduction.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Descartes now proceeds to further particulars, and
expresses himself as follows: “We consider what comes
under consciousness either as things or their qualities, or
as eternal truths which have no existence outside our
thought”—which do not belong to this or that time, to
this or that place. He calls those last something inborn
within us, something not made by us or merely felt,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> but the
eternal Notion of mind itself and the eternal determinations
of its freedom, of itself as itself. From this point the conception
that ideas are inborn (<i>innatæ ideæ</i>) hence proceeds;
this is the question over which Locke and Leibnitz dispute.
The expression “eternal truths” is current even in these
modern times, and it signifies the universal determinations
and relations which exist entirely on their own account.
The word ‘inborn’ is however a clumsy and stupid expression,
because the conception of physical birth thereby indicated,
does not apply to mind. To Descartes inborn ideas are
not universal, as they are to Plato and his successors, but
that which has evidence, immediate certainty, an immediate
multiplicity founded in thought itself—manifold conceptions
in the form of a Being, resembling what Cicero
calls natural feelings implanted in the heart. We would
rather say that such is implied in the nature and essence
of our mind and spirit. Mind is active and conducts itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
in its activity in a determinate manner; but this
activity has no other ground than its freedom. Yet if this
is the case more is required than merely to say so; it
must be deduced as a necessary product of our mind.
We have such ideas, for instance, in the logical laws:
“From nothing comes nothing,” “A thing cannot both
be and not be,”<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> as also in moral principles. These are
facts of consciousness which Descartes however soon passes
from again; they are only present in thought as subjective,
and he has thus not yet inquired respecting their
content.</p>

<p>As regards things, on which Descartes now directs his
attention, the other side to these eternal verities, the universal
determinations of things are substance, permanence,
order, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> He then gives definitions of these thoughts,
just as Aristotle draws up a list of the categories. But
although Descartes laid it down formerly as essential that
no hypotheses must be made, yet now he takes the conceptions,
and passes on to them as something found within
our consciousness. He defines substance thus: “By substance
I understand none other than a thing (<i>rem</i>) which
requires no other something for existence; and there is only
one thing, namely God, which can be regarded as such a
substance requiring no other thing.” This is what Spinoza
says; we may say that it is likewise the true definition, the
unity of Notion and reality: “All other” (things) “can
only exist by means of a concurrence (<i>concursus</i>) of God”;
what we still call substance outside of God thus does not
exist for itself, does not have its existence in the Notion
itself. That is then called the system of assistance (<i>systema
assistentiæ</i>) which is, however, transcendental. God is the
absolute uniter of Notion and actuality; other things,
finite things which have a limit and stand in dependence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
require something else. “Hence if we likewise call other
things substances, this expression is not applicable both to
them and to God <i>univoce</i>, as is said in the schools; that is
to say no definite significance can be given to this word
which would equally apply both to God and to the
creatures.”<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>“But I do not recognize more than two sorts of things;
the one is that of thinking things, and the other that of
things which relate to what is extended.” Thought, the
Notion, the spiritual, the self-conscious, is what is at home
with itself, and its opposite is contained in what is extended,
spatial, separated, not at home with itself nor free. This
is the real distinction (<i>distinctio realis</i>) of substances: “The
one substance can be clearly and definitely comprehended
without the other. But the corporeal and the thinking
and creating substance can be comprehended under this
common notion, for the reason that they are things which
require God’s support alone in order to exist.” They are
universal; other finite things require other things as conditions
essential to their existence. But extended substance,
the kingdom of nature, and spiritual substance, do
not require one another.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> They may be called substances,
because each of them constitutes an entire range or sphere,
an independent totality. But because, Spinoza concluded,
each side, the kingdom of thought as well as nature, is one
complete system within itself, they are likewise in themselves,
that is absolutely, identical as God, the absolute
substance; for thinking spirit this implicit is thus God, or
their differences are ideal.</p>

<p>Descartes proceeds from the Notion of God to what is
created, to thought and extension, and from this to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
particular. “Now substances have several attributes without
which they cannot be thought”—that signifies their
determinateness—“but each has something peculiar to itself
which constitutes its nature and essence”—a simple universal
determinateness—“and to which the others all relate. Thus
thought constitutes the absolute attribute of mind,”
thought is its quality; “extension is” the essential determination
of corporeality, and this alone is “the true nature
of body. What remains are merely secondary qualities,
modes, like figure and movement in what is extended, imagination,
feeling and will in thinking; they may be taken
away or thought away. God is the uncreated, thinking
substance.”<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Descartes here passes to what is individual, and because
he follows up extension he arrives at matter, rest, movement.
One of Descartes’ main points is that matter,
extension, corporeality, are quite the same thing for
thought; according to him the nature of body is fulfilled
in its extension, and this should be accepted as the only
essential fact respecting the corporeal world. We say that
body offers resistance, has smell, taste, colour, transparency,
hardness, &amp;c., since without these we can have no
body. All these further determinations respecting what is
extended, such as size, rest, movement, and inertia, are,
however, merely sensuous, and this Descartes showed, as it
had long before this been shown by the Sceptics. Undoubtedly
that is the abstract Notion or pure essence, but
to body or to pure existence, there likewise of necessity
pertains negativity or diversity. By means of the following
illustration Descartes showed that with the exception of
extension, all corporeal determinations may be annihilated,
and that none can be absolutely predicated. We draw
conclusions respecting the solidity and hardness of matter
from the resistance which a body offers to our disturbance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and by means of which it seeks to hold its place. Now if
we admit that matter as we touch it always gives way to us
like space, we should have no reason for ascribing to it
solidity. Smell, colour, taste, are in the same way sensuous
qualities merely; but what we clearly perceive is alone
true. If a body is ground into small parts, it gives way,
and yet it does not lose its nature; resistance is thus not
essential.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> This not-being-for-itself is however a quantitatively
slighter resistance only; the resistance always
remains. But Descartes desires only to think; now he
does not think resistance, colour, &amp;c., but apprehends them
by the senses only. Hence he says that all this must be led
back to extension as being special modifications of the same.
It is undoubtedly to the credit of Descartes that he only
accepts as true what is thought; but the abrogation of these
sensuous qualities simply represents the negative movement
of thought: the essence of body is conditioned through this
thought, that is, it is not true essence.</p>

<p>Descartes now makes his way from the Notion of extension
to the laws of motion, as the universal knowledge of
the corporeal in its implicitude; he shows (α) that there
is no vacuum, for that would be an extension without
bodily substance, <i>i.e.</i> a body without body; (β) that there
are no atoms (no indivisible independent existence), for the
same reason, viz., because the essence of body is extension.
(γ) He further shows that a body is set in motion by something
outside of it, but of itself it continues in a condition
of rest, and likewise it must, when in a condition of movement,
be brought to rest by another outside of it—this is
the property of inertia.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> These are unmeaning propositions,
for an abstraction is involved for instance in asserting
simple rest and movement in their opposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Extension and motion are the fundamental conceptions
in mechanical physics; they represent the truth of the
corporeal world. It is thus that ideality comes before the
mind of Descartes, and he is far elevated above the reality
of the sensuous qualities, although he does not reach so far
as to the separation of this ideality. He thus remains
at the point of view of mechanism pure and simple. Give
me matter (extension) and motion and I will build worlds
for you, is what Descartes virtually says.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Space and time
were hence to him the only determinations of the material
universe. In this, then, lies the mechanical fashion of
viewing nature, or the natural philosophy of Descartes is
seen to be purely mechanical.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Hence changes in matter
are due merely to motion, so that Descartes traces every
relationship to the rest and movement of particles, and all
material diversity such as colour, and taste—in short, all
bodily qualities and animal phenomena—to mechanism. In
living beings processes such as that of digestion are
mechanical effects which have as principles, rest and
movement. We here see the ground and origin of the
mechanical philosophy; but further on we find that this
is unsatisfactory, for matter and motion do not suffice to
explain life. Yet the great matter in all this is that
thought goes forward in its determinations, and that it
constitutes from these thought-determinations the truth
of nature.</p>

<p>In his consideration of the system of the world and the
movement of the heavenly bodies, Descartes has worked
out the mechanical view more fully. He thus comes to
speak of the earth, the sun, &amp;c., and of his conception of
the circling motion of the heavenly bodies in the form of
vortices: of metaphysical hypotheses as to how small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
particles pass into, out of, and through pores and act on
one another; and finally to saltpetre and gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Universal reflections should have the first claim on our
attention; but on the other hand the transition to the determinate
is accomplished in a system of Physics which is the
result of observations and experiences, and this is done
entirely by means of the understanding. Descartes thus
mingles many observations with a metaphysic of this nature,
and to us the result is hence obscure. In this philosophy
the thinking treatment of empiricism is thus predominant,
and a similar method has been adopted by philosophers from
this time on. To Descartes and others, Philosophy had still
the more indefinite significance of arriving at knowledge
through thought, reflection, and reasoning. Speculative
cognition, the derivation from the Notion, the free independent
development of the matter itself, was first introduced
by Fichte, and consequently what is now called philosophic
knowledge is not yet separated in Descartes from the rest of
scientific knowledge. In those times all the knowledge of
mankind was called philosophy; in Descartes’ metaphysics
we thus saw quite empirical reflection and reasoning from
particular grounds, from experiences, facts, phenomena,
being brought into play in the naivest manner, and one
has no sense of speculation in the matter. The strictly
scientific element here really consisted mainly in the
method of proof as it has long been made use of in
geometry, and in the ordinary method of the formal logical
syllogism. Hence it likewise happens that Philosophy,
which ought to form a totality of the sciences, begins with
logic and metaphysics; the second part is composed of
ordinary physics and mathematics, mingled no doubt with
metaphysical speculations, and the third part, ethics, deals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with the nature of man, his duties, the state, the citizen.
And this is the case with Descartes. The first part of
the <i>Principia philosophiæ</i> treats <i>De principiis cognitionis
humanæ</i>, the second <i>De principiis rerum materialium</i>. This
natural philosophy, as a philosophy of extension, is, however,
none other than what a quite ordinary physics or
mechanics might at that time be, and it is still quite hypothetical;
we, on the other hand, accurately distinguish
empirical physics and natural philosophy, even though the
first likewise pertains to thought.</p>

<p>3. Descartes never reached the third part, the philosophy
of Mind, for, while he made a special study of physics, in
the region of ethics he published one tract only, <i>De passionibus</i>.
In this reference Descartes treats of thought
and human freedom. He proves freedom from the fact of
the soul thinking that the will is unrestrained, and of that
constituting the perfection of mankind. And this is quite
true. In respect to the freedom of the will he comes
across the difficulty of how to reconcile it with the divine
prescience. As free, man might do what is not ordained
of God beforehand—this would conflict with the omnipotence
and omniscience of God; and if everything is
ordained of God, human freedom would thereby be done
away with. Yet he does not solve the contradiction contained
in these two different aspects without falling into
difficulty. But conformably to the method which he adopts,
and which we pointed out above (pp. 238, 239), he says: “The
human mind is finite, God’s power and predetermination are
infinite; we are thus not capable of judging of the relationship
in which the freedom of the human soul stands to the
omnipotence and omniscience of God—but in self-consciousness
we have the certainty of it given us as a fact. And
we must hold only to what is certain.”<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> When he proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
further much appears to him still incapable of explanation;
but we see obstinacy and caprice likewise exhibited in
his stopping short at the assertion as to the best of his
knowledge. The method of knowledge as set forth by
Descartes, takes the form of a reasoning of the understanding,
and is thus without special interest.</p>

<p>These, then, are the principal points in the Cartesian
system. Some particular assertions made by Descartes,
which have been specially instrumental in giving him
fame, have still to be mentioned—particular forms which
have been formerly considered in metaphysics, and likewise
by Wolff. For example, in the first place we gather that
Descartes regarded animals and other organisms as
machines moved by another, and not possessing the principle
of the spontaneity of thought within them<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>—a
mechanical physiology, a cut and dry thought pertaining
to the understanding, which is of no further importance.
In the sharp opposition between thought and extension,
the former is not considered as sensation, so that the
latter can isolate itself. The organic must as body
reduce itself to extension; any further development of
this last thus only proves its dependence on the first
determinations.</p>

<p>In the second place, the relation between soul and body
now becomes an important question, that is, the return
of the object within itself in such a way that thought
posits itself in another, in matter. As to this, many
systems are offered to us in metaphysics. One of these
is the <i>influxus physicus</i>, that the relation of spirit is
of a corporeal nature, that the object is related to mind
as bodies are to one another—a conception like this is very
crude. How does Descartes understand the unity of soul
and body? The former belongs to thought, the latter to
extension; and thus because both are substance, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
requires the Notion of the other, and hence soul and body
are independent of one another and can exercise no direct
influence upon one another. Soul could only influence
body in so far as it required the same, and conversely—that
is, in so far as they have actual relation to one
another. But since each is a totality, neither can bear a
real relation to the other. Descartes consistently denied
the physical influence of one on the other; that would have
signified a mechanical relation between the two. Descartes
thus established the intellectual sphere in contradistinction
to matter, and on it based the independent subsistence of
mind; for in his <i>cogito</i> ‘I’ is at first only certain of itself,
since I can abstract from all. Now we find the necessity
of a mediator to bring about a union of the abstract and
the external and individual. Descartes settles this by
placing between the two what constitutes the metaphysical
ground of their mutual changes, God. He is the intermediate
bond of union, in as far as He affords assistance
to the soul in what it cannot through its own freedom
accomplish, so that the changes in body and soul may
correspond with one another.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> If I have desires, an intention,
these receive corporeal realization; this association
of soul and body is, according to Descartes, effected through
God. For above (p. 239) we saw that Descartes says of
God that He is the Truth of the conception: as long as
I think rightly and consistently, something real corresponds
to my thought, and the connecting link is God.
God is hereby the perfect identity of the two opposites,
since He is, as Idea, the unity of Notion and reality. In
the Idea of Spinoza this is worked out and developed in its
further moments. Descartes’ conclusion is quite correct;
in finite things this identity is imperfect. Only the form
employed by Descartes is inadequate; for it implies that in
the beginning there are two things, thought or soul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
body, and that then God appears as a third thing, outside
both—that He is not the Notion of unity, nor are the
two elements themselves Notion. We must not however
forget that Descartes says that both those original elements
are created substances. But this expression ‘created’
pertains to the ordinary conception only and is not a
determinate thought; it was Spinoza, therefore, who first
accomplished this return to thought.</p>

<h3><a id="c252">2. <span class="smcap">Spinoza.</span></a></h3>

<p>The philosophy of Descartes underwent a great variety
of unspeculative developments, but in Benedict Spinoza a
direct successor to this philosopher may be found, and one
who carried on the Cartesian principle to its furthest logical
conclusions. For him soul and body, thought and Being,
cease to have separate independent existence. The dualism
of the Cartesian system Spinoza, as a Jew, altogether set
aside. For the profound unity of his philosophy as it found
expression in Europe, his manifestation of Spirit as the
identity of the finite and the infinite in God, instead of God’s
appearing related to these as a Third—all this is an echo
from Eastern lands. The Oriental theory of absolute identity
was brought by Spinoza much more directly into line,
firstly with the current of European thought, and then with
the European and Cartesian philosophy, in which it soon
found a place.</p>

<p>First of all we must, however, glance at the circumstances
of Spinoza’s life. He was by descent a Portuguese
Jew, and was born at Amsterdam in the year 1632; the
name he received was Baruch, but he altered it to Benedict.
In his youth he was instructed by the Rabbis of the synagogue
to which he belonged, but he soon fell out with them,
their wrath having been kindled by the criticisms which he
passed on the fantastic doctrines of the Talmud. He was
not, therefore, long in absenting himself from the synagogue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and as the Rabbis were in dread lest his example
should have evil consequences, they offered him a yearly
allowance of a thousand gulden if he would keep away from
the place and hold his tongue. This offer he declined; and
the Rabbis thereafter carried their persecution of him to
such a pitch that they were even minded to rid themselves
of him by assassination. After having made a narrow
escape from the dagger, he formally withdrew from the
Jewish communion, without, however, going over to the
Christian Church. He now applied himself particularly to
the Latin language, and made a special study of the Cartesian
philosophy. Later on he went to Rhynsburg, near
Leyden, and from the year 1664 he lived in retirement,
first at Voorburg, a village near the Hague, and then at the
Hague itself, highly respected by numerous friends: he
gained a livelihood for himself by grinding optical glasses.
It was no arbitrary choice that led him to occupy himself
with light, for it represents in the material sphere the absolute
identity which forms the foundation of the Oriental
view of things. Although he had rich friends and mighty
protectors, among whom even generals were numbered, he
lived in humble poverty, declining the handsome gifts
offered to him time after time. Nor would he permit Simon
von Vries to make him his heir; he only accepted from
him an annual pension of three hundred florins; in the
same way he gave up to his sisters his share of their father’s
estate. From the Elector Palatine, Carl Ludwig, a man of
most noble character and raised above the prejudices of his
time, he received the offer of a professor’s chair at Heidelberg,
with the assurance that he would have liberty to teach
and to write, because “the Prince believed he would
not put that liberty to a bad use by interfering with the
religion publicly established.” Spinoza (in his published
letters) very wisely declined this offer, however, because
“he did not know within what limits that philosophic
liberty would have to be confined, in order that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
not appear to be interfering with the publicly established
religion.” He remained in Holland, a country highly interesting
in the history of general culture, as it was the
first in Europe to show the example of universal toleration,
and afforded to many a place of refuge where they might
enjoy liberty of thought; for fierce as was the rage of the
theologians there against Bekker, for example (Bruck. Hist.
crit. phil. T. IV. P. 2, pp. 719, 720), and furious as were
the attacks of Voetius on the Cartesian philosophy, these
had not the consequences which they would have had in
another land. Spinoza died on the 21st of February, 1677,
in the forty-fourth year of his age. The cause of his death
was consumption, from which he had long been a sufferer;
this was in harmony with his system of philosophy, according
to which all particularity and individuality pass away in the
one substance. A Protestant divine, Colerus by name, who
published a biography of Spinoza, inveighs strongly against
him, it is true, but gives nevertheless a most minute and
kindly description of his circumstances and surroundings—telling
how he left only about two hundred thalers, what
debts he had, and so on. A bill included in the inventory,
in which the barber requests payment due him by M.
Spinoza of blessed memory, scandalizes the parson very
much, and regarding it he makes the observation: “Had
the barber but known what sort of a creature Spinoza was,
he certainly would not have spoken of his blessed memory.”
The German translator of this biography writes under the
portrait of Spinoza: <i>characterem, reprobationis in vultu
gerens</i>, applying this description to a countenance which
doubtless expresses the melancholy of a profound thinker,
but is otherwise mild and benevolent. The <i>reprobatio</i> is
certainly correct; but it is not a reprobation in the passive
sense; it is an active disapprobation on Spinoza’s part of
the opinions, errors and thoughtless passions of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Spinoza used the terminology of Descartes, and also
published an account of his system. For we find the first
of Spinoza’s works entitled “An Exposition according to
the geometrical method of the principles of the Cartesian
philosophy.” Some time after this he wrote his <i>Tractatus
theologico-politicus</i>, and by it gained considerable reputation.
Great as was the hatred which Spinoza roused amongst
his Rabbis, it was more than equalled by the odium which
he brought upon himself amongst Christian, and especially
amongst Protestant theologians—chiefly through the
medium of this essay. It contains his views on inspiration,
a critical treatment of the books of Moses and the like,
chiefly from the point of view that the laws therein
contained are limited in their application to the Jews.
Later Christian theologians have written critically on this
subject, usually making it their object to show that these
books were compiled at a later time, and that they date in
part from a period subsequent to the Babylonian captivity;
this has become a crucial point with Protestant theologians,
and one by which the modern school distinguishes
itself from the older, greatly pluming itself thereon. All
this, however, is already to be found in the above-mentioned
work of Spinoza. But Spinoza drew the greatest odium
upon himself by his philosophy proper, which we must now
consider as it is given to us in his Ethics. While Descartes
published no writings on this subject, the Ethics of Spinoza
is undoubtedly his greatest work; it was published after
his death by Ludwig Mayer, a physician, who had been
Spinoza’s most intimate friend. It consists of five parts;
the first deals with God (<i>De Deo</i>). General metaphysical
ideas are contained in it, which include the knowledge of
God and nature. The second part deals with the nature
and origin of mind (<i>De natura et origine mentis</i>). We see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
thus that Spinoza does not treat of the subject of natural
philosophy, extension and motion at all, for he passes
immediately from God to the philosophy of mind, to the
ethical point of view; and what refers to knowledge, intelligent
mind, is brought forward in the first part, under
the head of the principles of human knowledge. The third
book of the Ethics deals with the origin and nature of the
passions (<i>De origine et natura affectuum</i>); the fourth with
the powers of the same, or human slavery (<i>De servitute
humana seu de affectuum viribus</i>); the fifth, lastly, with the
power of the understanding, with thought, or with human
liberty (<i>De potentia intellectus seu de libertate humana</i>).<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Kirchenrath Professor Paulus published Spinoza’s works in
Jena; I had a share in the bringing out of this edition,
having been entrusted with the collation of French translations.</p>

<p>As regards the philosophy of Spinoza, it is very simple,
and on the whole easy to comprehend; the difficulty which
it presents is due partly to the limitations of the method
in which Spinoza presents his thoughts, and partly to his
narrow range of ideas, which causes him in an unsatisfactory
way to pass over important points of view and cardinal
questions. Spinoza’s system is that of Descartes made
objective in the form of absolute truth. The simple thought
of Spinoza’s idealism is this: The true is simply and solely
the one substance, whose attributes are thought and extension
or nature: and only this absolute unity is reality, it
alone is God. It is, as with Descartes, the unity of
thought and Being, or that which contains the Notion of
its existence in itself. The Cartesian substance, as Idea,
has certainly Being included in its Notion; but it is only
Being as abstract, not as real Being or as extension (<i>supra</i>,
p. 241). With Descartes corporeality and the thinking ‘I’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
are altogether independent Beings; this independence of
the two extremes is done away with in Spinozism by
their becoming moments of the one absolute Being. This
expression signifies that Being must be grasped as the unity
of opposites; the chief consideration is not to let slip the
opposition and set it aside, but to reconcile and resolve it.
Since then it is thought and Being, and no longer the abstractions
of the finite and infinite, or of limit and the unlimited,
that form the opposition (<i>supra</i>, p. 161), Being is
here more definitely regarded as extension; for in its
abstraction it would be really only that return into itself,
that simple equality with itself, which constitutes thought
(<i>supra</i>, p. 229). The pure thought of Spinoza is therefore
not the simple universal of Plato, for it has likewise come
to know the absolute opposition of Notion and Being.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, this constitutes the Idea of
Spinoza, and it is just what τὸ ὄν was to the Eleatics
(Vol. I. pp. 244, 252). This Idea of Spinoza’s we must
allow to be in the main true and well-grounded; absolute
substance is the truth, but it is not the whole truth; in
order to be this it must also be thought of as in itself active
and living, and by that very means it must determine itself
as mind. But substance with Spinoza is only the universal
and consequently the abstract determination of mind; it
may undoubtedly be said that this thought is the foundation
of all true views—not, however, as their absolutely
fixed and permanent basis, but as the abstract unity which
mind is in itself. It is therefore worthy of note that
thought must begin by placing itself at the standpoint of
Spinozism; to be a follower of Spinoza is the essential
commencement of all Philosophy. For as we saw above
(Vol I. p. 144), when man begins to philosophize, the soul
must commence by bathing in this ether of the One Substance,
in which all that man has held as true has disappeared;
this negation of all that is particular, to which
every philosopher must have come, is the liberation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
mind and its absolute foundation. The difference between
our standpoint and that of the Eleatic philosophy is only this,
that through the agency of Christianity concrete individuality
is in the modern world present throughout in spirit.
But in spite of the infinite demands on the part of the
concrete, substance with Spinoza is not yet determined as in
itself concrete. As the concrete is thus not present in the
content of substance, it is therefore to be found within
reflecting thought alone, and it is only from the endless
oppositions of this last that the required unity emerges.
Of substance as such there is nothing more to be said; all
that we can do is to speak of the different ways in which
Philosophy has dealt with it, and the opposites which in it
are abrogated. The difference depends on the nature of
the opposites which are held to be abrogated in substance.
Spinoza is far from having proved this unity as convincingly
as was done by the ancients; but what constitutes the
grandeur of Spinoza’s manner of thought is that he is able
to renounce all that is determinate and particular, and
restrict himself to the One, giving heed to this alone.</p>

<p>1. Spinoza begins (Eth. P. I pp. 35, 36) with a series
of definitions, from which we take the following.</p>

<p>a. Spinoza’s first definition is of the Cause of itself.
He says: “By that which is <i>causa sui</i>, its own cause, I
understand that whose essence” (or Notion) “involves
existence, or which cannot be conceived except as
existent.” The unity of existence and universal thought
is asserted from the very first, and this unity will ever be
the question at issue. “The cause of itself” is a noteworthy
expression, for while we picture to ourselves that
the effect stands in opposition to the cause, the cause of
itself is the cause which, while it operates and separates an
“other,” at the same time produces only itself, and in the
production therefore does away with this distinction. The
establishing of itself as an other is loss or degeneration,
and at the same time the negation of this loss; this is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
purely speculative Notion, indeed a fundamental Notion in
all speculation. The cause in which the cause is identical
with the effect, is the infinite cause (<i>infra</i>, p. 263); if
Spinoza had further developed what lies in the <i>causa sui</i>,
substance with him would not have been rigid and
unworkable.</p>

<p>b. The second definition is that of the finite. “That
thing is said to be finite in its kind which can be limited
by another of the same nature,” For it comes then to an
end, it is not there; what is there is something else. This
something else must, however, be of a like nature; for
those things which are to limit each other must, in order to
be able to limit each other, touch each other, and consequently
have a relation to each other, that is to say they
must be of one nature, stand on a like basis, and have a
common sphere. That is the affirmative side of the limit.
“Thus a thought is” only “limited by another thought, a
body by another body, but thoughts are not limited by
bodies nor” conversely “bodies by thoughts.” We saw
this (p. 244) with Descartes: thought is an independent
totality and so is extension, they have nothing to do with
one another; they do not limit each other, each is included
in itself.</p>

<p>c. The third definition is that of substance. “By
substance I understand that which exists in itself and is
conceived by itself, <i>i.e.</i> the conception of which does
not require the aid of the conception of any other thing for
its formation (<i>a quo formari debeat</i>);” otherwise it would
be finite, accidental. What cannot have a conception
formed of it without the aid of something else, is not independent,
but is dependent upon that something else.</p>

<p>d. In the fourth place Spinoza defines attributes, which,
as the moment coming second to substance, belong to it.
“By attribute I understand that which the mind perceives
as constituting the essence of substance;” and to Spinoza
this alone is true. This is an important determination; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
attribute is undoubtedly a determinateness, but at the
same time it remains a totality. Spinoza, like Descartes,
accepts only two attributes, thought and extension. The
understanding grasps them as the reality of substance, but
the reality is not higher than the substance, for it is only
reality in the view of the understanding, which falls
outside substance. Each of the two ways of regarding
substance—extension and thought—contains no doubt the
whole content of substance, but only in one form, which
the understanding brings with it; and for this very
reason both sides are in themselves identical and infinite.
This is the true completion; but where substance passes
over into attribute is not stated.</p>

<p>e. The fifth definition has to do with what comes third
in relation to substance, the mode. “By mode I understand
the affections of substance, or that which is in something
else, through the aid of which also it is conceived.”
Thus substance is conceived through itself; attribute is not
conceived through itself, but has a relation to the conceiving
understanding, in so far as this last conceives
reality; mode, finally, is what is not conceived as reality,
but through and in something else.</p>

<p>These last three moments Spinoza ought not merely to
have established in this way as conceptions, he ought to
have deduced them; they are especially important, and
correspond with what we more definitely distinguish as
universal, particular and individual. They must not, however,
be taken as formal, but in their true concrete sense;
the concrete universal is substance, the concrete particular
is the concrete species; the Father and Son in the
Christian dogma are similarly particular, but each of them
contains the whole nature of God, only under a different
form. The mode is the individual, the finite as such,
which enters into external connection with what is “other.”
In this Spinoza only descends to a lower stage, the mode
is only the foregoing warped and stunted. Spinoza’s defect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
is therefore this, that he takes the third moment as mode
alone, as a false individuality. True individuality and
subjectivity is not a mere retreat from the universal, not
merely something clearly determinate; for, as clearly
determinate, it is at the same time Being-for-itself,
determined by itself alone. The individual, the subjective,
is even in being so the return to the universal; and in
that it is at home with itself, it is itself the universal.
The return consists simply and solely in the fact of the
particular being in itself the universal; to this return
Spinoza did not attain. Rigid substantiality is the last
point he reached, not infinite form; this he knew not,
and thus determinateness continually vanishes from his
thought.</p>

<p>f. In the sixth place, the definition of the infinite is also
of importance, for in the infinite Spinoza defines more
strictly than anywhere else the Notion of the Notion. The
infinite has a double significance, according as it is taken
as the infinitely many or as the absolutely infinite (<i>infra</i>,
p. 263). “The infinite in its kind is not such in respect
of all possible attributes; but the absolutely infinite is
that to whose essence all belongs that expresses an essence
and contains no negation.” In the same sense Spinoza
distinguishes in the nine-and-twentieth Letter (Oper. T. I.
pp. 526-532) the infinite of imagination from the infinite
of thought (<i>intellectus</i>), the actual (<i>actu</i>) infinite. Most
men, when they wish to strive after the sublime, get no
farther than the first of these; this is the false infinite,
just as when one says “and so on into infinity,” meaning
perhaps the infinity of space from star to star, or else the
infinity of time. An infinite numerical series in mathematics
is exactly the same thing. If a certain fraction is
represented as a decimal fraction, it is incomplete; ⅐\u2150 is, on
the contrary, the true infinite, and therefore not an incomplete
expression, although the content here is of course
limited. It is infinity in the incorrect sense that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
usually has in view when infinity is spoken of; and even if
it is looked on as sublime, it yet is nothing present, and
only goes ever out into the negative, without being actual
(<i>actu</i>). But for Spinoza the infinite is not the fixing of a
limit and then passing beyond the limit fixed—the sensuous
infinity—but absolute infinity, the positive, which has complete
and present in itself an absolute multiplicity which
has no Beyond. Philosophic infinity, that which is
infinite <i>actu</i>, Spinoza therefore calls the absolute affirmation
of itself. This is quite correct, only it might have been
better expressed as: “It is the negation of negation.”
Spinoza here also employs geometrical figures as illustrations
of the Notion of infinity. In his <i>Opera postuma</i>,
preceding his Ethics, and also in the letter quoted above,
he has two circles, one of which lies
within the other, which have not, however,
a common centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/graph.jpg" width="400" height="450"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>“The inequalities of the space between
A B and C D exceed every
number; and yet the space which lies
between is not so very great.” That
is to say, if I wish to determine them
all, I must enter upon an infinite series.
This “beyond” always, however, remains defective, is
always affected with negation; and yet this false infinite
is there to hand, circumscribed, affirmative, actual and
present in that plane as a complete space between the two
circles. Or a finite line consists of an infinite number of
points; and yet the line is present here and determined;
the “beyond” of the infinite number of points, which are
not complete, is in it complete and called back into unity.
The infinite should be represented as actually present, and
this comes to pass in the Notion of the cause of itself,
which is therefore the true infinity. As soon as the cause
has something else opposed to it—the effect—finitude is
present; but here this something else is at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
abrogated and it becomes once more the cause itself. The
affirmative is thus negation of negation, since, according to
the well-known grammatical rule, <i>duplex negatio affirmat</i>. In
the same way Spinoza’s earlier definitions have also the
infinite already implied in them, for instance in the case of the
just mentioned cause of itself, inasmuch as he defines it as
that whose essence involves existence (<i>supra</i>, p. 258). Notion
and existence are each the Beyond of the other; but cause
of itself, as thus including them, is really the carrying back
of this “beyond” into unity. Or (<i>supra</i>, p. 259) “Substance
is that which is in itself and is conceived from
itself;” that is the same unity of Notion and existence.
The infinite is in the same way in itself and has also
its Notion in itself; its Notion is its Being, and its
Being its Notion; true infinity is therefore to be found
in Spinoza. But he has no consciousness of this; he
has not recognized this Notion as absolute Notion,
and therefore has not expressed it as a moment of true
existence; for with him the Notion falls outside of
existence, into the thought of existence.</p>

<p>g. Finally Spinoza says in the seventh place: “God is a
Being absolutely infinite, <i>i.e.</i> a substance consisting of
infinite attributes, each of which expresses an eternal and
infinite essence.” Does substance, one might here ask,
possess an infinite number of attributes? But as with
Spinoza there are only two attributes, thought and extension,
with which he invests God, “infinite” is not to
be taken here in the sense of the indeterminate many,
but positively, as a circle is perfect infinity in itself.</p>

<p>The whole of Spinoza’s philosophy is contained in these
definitions, which, however, taken as a whole are formal;
it is really a weak point in Spinoza that he begins thus with
definitions. In mathematics this method is permitted,
because at the outset we there make assumptions, such as
that of the point and line; but in Philosophy the content
should be known as the absolutely true. It is all very well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to grant the correctness of the name-definition, and acknowledge
that the word “substance” corresponds with the
conception which the definition indicates, but it is quite
another question to determine whether this content is
absolutely true. Such a question is not asked in the case
of geometrical propositions, but in philosophic investigation
it is the very thing to be first considered, and this
Spinoza has not done. Instead of only explaining these
simple thoughts and representing them as concrete in the
definitions which he makes, what he ought to have done
was to examine whether this content is true. To all appearance
it is only the explanation of the words that is given;
but the content of the words is held to be established. All
further content is merely derived from that, and proved
thereby; for on the first content all the rest depends,
and if it is established as a basis, the other necessarily
follows. “The attribute is that which the understanding
thinks of God.” But here the question is: How does it
come that besides the Deity there now appears the understanding,
which applies to absolute substance the two forms
of thought and extension? and whence come these two
forms themselves? Thus everything proceeds inwards, and
not outwards; the determinations are not developed from
substance, it does not resolve itself into these attributes.</p>

<p>2. These definitions are followed by axioms and propositions
in which Spinoza proves a great variety of points.
He descends from the universal of substance through the
particular, thought and extension, to the individual. He
has thus all three moments of the Notion, or they are
essential to him. But the mode, under which head falls
individuality, he does not recognize as essential, or as constituting
a moment of true existence in that existence; for
it disappears in existence, or it is not raised into the
Notion.</p>

<p>a. The main point then is that Spinoza proves from these
Notions that there is only One Substance, God. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
simple chain of reasoning, a very formal proof. “Fifth
Proposition: There cannot be two or more substances of
the same nature or of the same attribute.” This is implied
already in the definitions; the proof is therefore a useless
and wearisome toil, which only serves to render Spinoza
more difficult to understand. “If there were several”
(substances of the same attribute) “they must be distinguished
from one another either by the diversity of their
attributes or by the diversity of their affections” (modes).
“If they are distinguished by their attributes, it would be
directly conceded that there is only one substance having
the same attribute.” For the attributes are simply what the
understanding grasps as the essence of the one substance,
which is determined in itself, and not through anything else.
“But if these substances were distinguished by their
affections, since substance is by nature prior to its affections
it would follow that if from substance its affections were
abstracted and it were regarded in itself, <i>i.e.</i> in its truth, it
could henceforth not be regarded as distinct from other
substances.” “Eighth Proposition: All substance is necessarily
infinite. Proof: For otherwise it must be limited by
another substance of the same nature, in which case there
would be two substances of the same attribute, which is
contrary to the fifth proposition.” “Every attribute must
be conceived for itself,” as determination reflected on itself.
“For attribute is what the mind conceives of substance as
constituting its essence, from which it follows that it must
be conceived through itself,” <i>i.e.</i> substance is what is
conceived through itself (see the fourth and third definitions).
“Therefore we may not argue from the plurality of
attributes to a plurality of substances, for each is conceived
by itself, and they have all been, always and at the same
time, in substance, without the possibility of the one being
produced by the other.” “Substance is indivisible. For if
the parts retained the nature of the substance, there would
be several substances of the same nature, which is contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to the fifth proposition. If not, infinite substance would
cease to exist, which is absurd.”<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>“Fourteenth Proposition: No other substance than God
can either exist or be conceived. Proof: God is the absolutely
infinite substance, to whom can be denied no attribute
which expresses the essence of substance, and He
exists necessarily; therefore if there were a substance
other than God, it must be explained by means of an attribute
of God.” Consequently the substance would not
have its own being, but that of God, and therefore would
not be a substance. Or if it were still to be substance,
“then there would necessarily follow the possibility of
there being two substances with the same attribute, which
according to the fifth proposition is absurd. From this it
then follows that the thing extended and the thing that
thinks” are not substances, but “are either attributes of
God, or affections of His attributes.” By these proofs and
others like them not much is to be gained. “Fifteenth,
proposition: What is, is in God, and cannot exist or be
conceived without God.” “Sixteenth proposition: By the
necessity of the divine nature infinite things must follow
in infinite modes, <i>i.e.</i>, all that can fall under the infinite
understanding. God is therefore the absolute First Cause.”<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Spinoza then ascribes freedom and necessity to God:
“God is the absolute free cause, who is determined by
nothing outside of Himself, for He exists solely by the
necessity of His nature. There is no cause which inwardly
or outwardly moves Him to act, except the perfection
of His nature. His activity is by the laws of His
Being necessary and eternal; what therefore follows from
His absolute nature, from His attributes, is eternal, as it follows
from the nature of the triangle from eternity and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
eternity that its three angles are equal to two right angles.”
That is to say, His Being is His absolute power; <i>actus</i> and
<i>potentia</i>, Thought and Being, are in Him one. God has not
therefore any other thoughts which He could not have
actualized. “God is the immanent cause of all things, not the
transient (<i>transiens</i>),” <i>i.e.</i>, external cause. “His essence and
His existence are the same, namely, the truth. A thing
which is determined to perform some action, is, since God is
cause, necessarily determined thereto by God; and a thing
which is thus determined cannot render itself undetermined.
In nature nothing is contingent. Will is not a free cause,
but only a necessary cause, only a mode; it is therefore
determined by another. God acts in accordance with no
final causes (<i>sub ratione boni</i>). Those who assert that He
does so, appear to establish something apart from God,
which does not depend on God, and which God in His
working keeps in view, as though it were an end. If this
view is taken, God is not a free cause, but is subject to fate.
It is equally inadmissible to subject all things to the
arbitrary pleasure of God, <i>i.e.</i>, to His indifferent will.”<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He
is determined solely by His own nature; the activity of
God is thus His power, and that is necessity. He is then
absolute power in contrast to wisdom, which sets up definite
aims, and consequently limitations; particular aims,
thoughts of what is about to come to pass, and the
like are therefore put out of the question. But beyond
this universal, no advance is made; for it must be noticed
as specially singular, that Spinoza in the fiftieth Letter
(Oper. T. I. p. 634) says that every determination is a negation.
Moreover, if God is the cause of the world, it is implied
that He is finite; for the world is here put beside
God as something different from Him.</p>

<p>b. The greatest difficulty in Spinoza is, in the distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to which he comes, to grasp the relation of this
determinate to God, at the same time preserving the
determination. “God is a thinking Being, because all
individual thoughts are modes which express God’s nature
in a certain and determinate manner; there pertains
therefore to God an attribute the conception of which all
individual thoughts involve, and by means of this they
also are conceived. God is an extended Being for the same
reason.” This means that the same substance, under the
attribute of thought, is the intelligible world, and under
the attribute of extension, is nature; nature and thought
thus both express the same Essence of God. Or, as
Spinoza says, “The order and system of natural things
is the same as the order of the thoughts. Thus, for instance,
the circle which exists in nature, and the idea of the
existing circle, which is also in God, are one and the same
thing” (they are one and the same content), “which is”
merely “expressed by means of different attributes. If
we therefore regard nature either under the attribute of
extension or of thought, or under any other attribute
whatever, we shall find one and the same connection of
causes, <i>i.e.</i>, the same sequence of things. The formal
Being of the idea of the circle can be conceived only by
means of the mode of thought, as its proximate cause, and
this mode again by means of another, and so on infinitely;
so that we must explain the order of the whole of nature, or
the connection of causes, by the attribute of thought alone,
and if things are considered by the attribute of extension,
they must be considered only by the attribute of extension,—and
the same holds good of other causes.”<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It is one and
the same system, which at one time appears as nature, and
at another time in the form of thought.</p>

<p>But Spinoza does not demonstrate how these two are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
evolved from the one substance, nor does he prove why there
can only be two of them. Neither are extension and
thought anything to him in themselves, or in truth, but
only externally; for their difference is a mere matter of
the understanding, which is ranked by Spinoza only
among affections (Eth. P. I. Prop. XXXI. Demonst. p. 62),
and as such has no truth. This has in recent times been
served up again by Schelling in the following form: In
themselves, the intelligent world and the corporeal world are
the same, only under different forms; so that the intelligent
universe is in itself the whole absolute divine totality,
and the corporeal universe is equally this same totality.
The differences are not in themselves, but the different
aspects from which the Absolute is regarded are matters
external to it. We take a higher tone in saying that
nature and mind are rational; but reason is for us no
empty word, for it means the totality which develops itself
within itself. Again, it is the standpoint of reflection to
regard aspects only, and nothing in itself. This defect
appears in Spinoza and Schelling in the fact that they see
no necessity why the Notion, as the implicit negative of its
unity, should make a separation of itself into different
parts; so that out of the simple universal the real, the
opposed, itself becomes known. Absolute substance,
attribute and mode, Spinoza allows to follow one another
as definitions, he adopts them ready-made, without the
attributes being developed from the substance, or the
modes from the attributes. And more especially in regard
to the attributes, there is no necessity evident, why these
are thought and extension in particular.</p>

<p>c. When Spinoza passes on to individual things,
especially to self-consciousness, to the freedom of the ‘I,’
he expresses himself in such a way as rather to lead back
all limitations to substance than to maintain a firm grasp
of the individual. Thus we already found the attributes
not to be independent, but only the forms in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
understanding grasps substance in its differences; what
comes third, the modes, is that under which for Spinoza
all difference of things alone falls. Of the modes he says
(Ethic. P. I. Prop. XXXII. Demonst. et Coroll. II. p. 63):
In every attribute there are two modes; in extension, these
are rest and motion, in thought they are understanding
and will (<i>intellectus et voluntas</i>). They are mere modifications
which only exist for us apart from God; therefore
whatever refers to this difference and is specially
brought about by it, is not absolute, but finite. These
affections Spinoza sums up (Ethices, P. I. Prop. XXIX.
Schol. pp. 61, 62) under the head of <i>natura naturata</i>:
“<i>Natura naturans</i> is God regarded as free cause, in so far
as He is in Himself and is conceived by Himself: or such
attributes of substance as express the eternal and infinite
essence. By <i>natura naturata</i>, I understand all that follows
from the necessity of the divine nature, or from any of the
attributes of God, all modes of the divine attributes, in so
far as they are regarded as things which are in God, and
which without God can neither exist nor be conceived.”
From God proceeds nothing, for all things merely return
to the point whence they came, if from themselves the
commencement is made.</p>

<p>These then are Spinoza’s general forms, this is his
principal idea. Some further determinations have still to
be mentioned. He gives definitions of the terms modes,
understanding, will, and of the affections, such as joy and
sadness.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> We further find consciousness taken into consideration.
Its development is extremely simple, or rather
it is not developed at all; Spinoza begins directly with
mind. “The essence of man consists of certain modifications
of the attributes of God”; these modifications are
only something related to our understanding. “If we,
therefore, say that the human mind perceives this or that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
it means nothing else than that God has this or that idea,
not in so far as He is infinite, but in so far as He is expressed
by the idea of the human mind. And if we say that God
has this or that idea, not in so far as He constitutes the idea
of the human mind, but in so far as He has, along with
the human mind, the idea of another thing, then we say
that the human mind perceives the thing partially or
inadequately.” Truth is for Spinoza, on the other hand,
the adequate.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> The idea that all particular content is only
a modification of God is ridiculed by Bayle,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> who argues
from it that God modified as Turks and Austrians, is
waging war with Himself; but Bayle has not a trace of
the speculative element in him, although he is acute enough
as a dialectician, and has contributed to the intelligent
discussion of definite subjects.</p>

<p>The relation of thought and extension in the human
consciousness is dealt with by Spinoza as follows: “What
has a place in the object” (or rather in the objective) “of
the idea which constitutes the human mind must be perceived
by the human mind; or there must necessarily be
in the mind an idea of this object. The object of the idea
which constitutes the human mind is body, or a certain
mode of extension. If, then, the object of the idea which
constitutes the human mind, is the body, there can happen
nothing in the body which is not perceived by the mind.
Otherwise the ideas of the affections of the body would not
be in God, in so far as He constitutes our mind, but the
idea of another thing: that is to say, the ideas of the
affections of our body would not be likewise in our
mind.” What is perplexing to understand in Spinoza’s
system is, on the one hand, the absolute identity of
thought and Being, and, on the other hand, their absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
indifference to one another, because each of them is a
manifestation of the whole essence of God. The unity of
the body and consciousness is, according to Spinoza, this,
that the individual is a mode of the absolute substance,
which, as consciousness, is the representation of the manner
in which the body is affected by external things; all
that is in consciousness is also in extension, and conversely.
“Mind knows itself only in so far as it perceives the ideas
of the affections of body,” it has only the idea of the
affections of its body; this idea is synthetic combination,
as we shall immediately see. “The ideas, whether of the
attributes of God or of individual things, do not recognize
as their efficient cause their objects themselves, or the
things perceived, but God Himself, in so far as He is that
which thinks.”<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Buhle (Geschichte der neuern Philos.
Vol. III. Section II. p. 524) sums up these propositions of
Spinoza thus: “Thought is inseparably bound up with
extension; therefore all that takes place in extension must
also take place in consciousness.” Spinoza, however,
also accepts both in their separation from one another.
The idea of body, he writes (Epistol. LXVI. p. 673),
includes only these two in itself, and does not express any
other attributes. The body which it represents is regarded
under the attribute of extension; but the idea itself is a
mode of thought. Here we see a dividing asunder; mere
identity, the undistinguishable nature of all things in the
Absolute, is insufficient even for Spinoza.</p>

<p>The <i>individuum</i>, individuality itself, is thus defined by
Spinoza (Ethic. P. II. Prop. XIII. Defin. p. 92): “When
several bodies of the same or of different magnitudes are so
pressed together that they rest on one another, or when,
moving with like or different degrees of rapidity, they
communicate their movement to one another in a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
measure, we say that such bodies are united to one another,
and that all together they form one body or individuum,
which by this union distinguishes itself from all the other
bodies.” Here we are at the extreme limit of Spinoza’s
system, and it is here that his weak point appears. Individuation,
the one, is a mere synthesis; it is quite a
different thing from the Ichts or self-hood of Boehme (<i>supra</i>,
pp. 205-207), since Spinoza has only universality, thought,
and not self-consciousness. If, before considering this in
reference to the whole, we take it from the other side,
namely from the understanding, the distinction really falls
under that head; it is not deduced, it is found. Thus, as
we have already seen (p. 270) “the understanding in act
(<i>intellectus actu</i>), as also will, desire, love, must be
referred to <i>natura naturata</i>, not to <i>natura naturans</i>. For
by the understanding, as recognized for itself, we do
not mean absolute thought, but only a certain mode of
thought—a mode which is distinct from other modes like
desire, love, etc., and on that account must be conceived by
means of absolute thought, <i>i.e.</i> by means of an attribute of
God which expresses an eternal and infinite essentiality of
thought; without which the understanding, as also the rest
of the modes of thought, could neither be nor be conceived
to be.” (Spinoza, Ethices, P. I. Propos. XXXI. pp. 62,
63). Spinoza is unacquainted with an infinity of form,
which would be something quite different from that of rigid,
unyielding substance. What is requisite is to recognize
God as the essence of essences, as universal substance,
identity, and yet to preserve distinctions.</p>

<p>Spinoza goes on to say: “What constitutes the real
(<i>actuale</i>) existence of the human mind is nothing else than
the idea of a particular” (individual) “thing, that actually
exists,” not of an infinite thing. “The essence of man
involves no necessary existence, <i>i.e.</i> according to the order
of nature a man may just as well be as not be.” For the
human consciousness, as it does not belong to essence as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
an attribute, is a mode—a mode of the attribute of thought.
But neither is the body, according to Spinoza, the cause of
consciousness, nor is consciousness the cause of the body,
but the finite cause is here only the relation of like to like;
body is determined by body, conception by conception.
“The body can neither determine the mind to thought, nor
can the mind determine the body to motion, or rest, or anything
else. For all modes of thought have God as Cause,
in so far as He is a thinking thing, and not in so far as He
is revealed by means of another attribute. What therefore
determines the mind to thought, is a mode of thought and
not of extension; similarly motion and rest of the body
must be derived from another body.”<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> I might quote many
other such particular propositions from Spinoza, but they
are very formal, and a continual repetition of one and the
same thing.</p>

<p>Buhle (Gesch. d. neuern Phil. Vol. III. Section 2, pp.
525-528), attributes limited conceptions to Spinoza: “The
soul experiences in the body all the ‘other’ of which it
becomes aware as outside of the body, and it becomes aware
of this ‘other’ only by means of the conceptions of the
qualities which the body perceives therein. If, therefore,
the body can perceive no qualities of a thing, the soul also
can come to no knowledge of it. On the other hand, the
soul is equally unable to arrive at the perception of the
body which belongs to it; the soul knows not that the body
is there, and knows itself even in no other way than by
means of the qualities which the body perceives in things
which are outside of it, and by means of the conceptions of
the same. For the body is an individual thing, determined
in a certain manner, which can only gradually, in association
with and amidst other individual things, attain to
existence, and can preserve itself in existence only as thus
connected, combined and associated with others,” <i>i.e.</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
infinite progress; the body can by no means be conceived
from itself. “The soul’s consciousness expresses a certain
determinate form of a Notion, as the Notion itself expresses
a determinate form of an individual thing. But the individual
thing, its Notion, and the Notion of this Notion are
altogether and entirely one and the same thing, only regarded
under different attributes. As the soul is nothing
else than the immediate Notion of the body, and is one
and the same thing with this, the excellence of the soul can
never be anything else than the excellence of the body.
The capacities of the understanding are nothing but the
capacities of the body, if they are looked at from the
corporeal point of view, and the decisions of the will are
likewise determinations of the body. Individual things are
derived from God in an eternal and infinite manner” (<i>i.e.</i>
once and for all), “and not in a transitory, finite and
evanescent manner: they are derived from one another
merely inasmuch as they mutually produce and destroy
each other, but in their eternal existence they endure unchangeable.
All individual things mutually presuppose
each other; one cannot be thought without the other; that
is to say they constitute together an inseparable whole;
they exist side by side in one utterly indivisible, infinite
Thing, and in no other way whatever.”</p>

<p>3. We have now to speak of Spinoza’s system of morals,
and that is a subject of importance. Its great principle is
no other than this, that the finite spirit is moral in so far
as it has the true Idea, <i>i.e.</i> in so far as it directs its knowledge
and will on God, for truth is merely the knowledge
of God. It may be said that there is no morality loftier
than this, since its only requisite is to have a clear idea of
God. The first thing Spinoza speaks of in this regard is
the affections: “Everything strives after self-preservation.
This striving is the actual essence of the thing, and involves
only indefinite time; when referred exclusively to mind, it
is termed will; when referred to both mind and body together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it is called desire. Determination of the will
(<i>volitio</i>) and Idea are one and the same thing. The sense
of liberty rests on this, that men do not know the determining
causes of their actions. The affection is a confused
idea; the more clearly and distinctly, therefore, we know
the affection, the more it is under our control.”<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The influence
of the affections, as confused and limited (inadequate)
ideas, upon human action, constitutes therefore,
according to Spinoza, human slavery; of the passionate
affections the principal are joy and sorrow; we are in
suffering and slavery in so far as we relate ourselves as a
part.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>“Our happiness and liberty consist in an enduring and
eternal love to God; this intellectual love follows from the
nature of mind, in so far as it is regarded as eternal truth
through the nature of God. The more a man recognizes
God’s existence and loves Him, the less does he suffer from
evil affections and the less is his fear of death.”<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Spinoza
requires in addition the true kind of knowledge. There
are, according to him, three kinds of knowledge; in the
first, which he calls opinion and imagination, he includes
the knowledge which we obtain from an individual object
through the senses—a knowledge fragmentary and ill-arranged—also
knowledge drawn from signs, pictorial conceptions
and memory. The second kind of knowledge is
for Spinoza that which we derive from general conceptions
and adequate ideas of the properties of things. The third
is intuitive knowledge (<i>scientia intuitiva</i>) which rises from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the adequate idea of the formal essence of certain attributes
of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Regarding this last he then says: “The nature of reason
is not to contemplate things as contingent, but as necessary
... to think of all things under a certain form of
eternity (<i>sub quadam specie œternitatis</i>);” <i>i.e.</i> in absolutely
adequate Notions, <i>i.e.</i> in God. “For the necessity of things
is the necessity of the eternal nature of God Himself.
Every idea of an individual thing necessarily includes the
eternal and infinite essence of God in itself. For individual
things are modes of an attribute of God; therefore
they must include in themselves His eternal essence. Our
mind, in so far as it knows itself and the body under the
form of eternity, has to that extent necessarily the knowledge
of God, and knows that it is itself in God and is
conceived through God. All Ideas, in so far as they are
referable to God, are true.”<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Man must trace back all
things to God, for God is the One in All; the eternal
essence of God is the one thing that is, the eternal truth is
the only thing for man to aim at in his actions. With
Spinoza this is not a knowledge arrived at through philosophy,
but only knowledge of a truth. “The mind can
succeed in tracing back all affections of the body or images
of things to God. In proportion as the mind regards all
things as necessary, it has a greater power over its affections,”
which are arbitrary and contingent. This is the
return of the mind to God, and this is human freedom; as
mode, on the other hand, the spirit has no freedom, but is
determined from without. “From the third kind of knowledge
there arises the repose of the mind; the supreme
good of the mind is to know God, and this is its highest
virtue. This knowledge necessarily produces the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
love of God; for it produces a joyfulness accompanied
by the Idea of God as cause—<i>i.e.</i> the intellectual
love of God. God Himself loves Himself with an infinite
intellectual love.”<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> For God can have only Himself as aim
and cause; and the end of the subjective mind is to be
directed on Him. This is therefore the purest, but also a
universal morality.</p>

<p>In the thirty-sixth Letter (pp. 581-582) Spinoza speaks
of Evil. The allegation is made that God, as the originator
of all things and everything, is also the originator of evil,
is consequently Himself evil; in this identity all things are
one, good and evil are in themselves the same thing, in
God’s substance this difference has disappeared. Spinoza
says in answer to this: “I assert the fact that God absolutely
and truly” (as cause of Himself) “is the cause of
everything that has an essential content” (<i>i.e.</i> affirmative
reality) “be it what it may. Now if you can prove to me
that evil, error, crime, etc., are something that expresses
an essence, I will freely admit to you that God is the originator
of crime and evil and error. But I have elsewhere
abundantly demonstrated that the form of evil cannot subsist
in anything that expresses an essence, and therefore it
cannot be said that God is the cause of evil.” Evil is
merely negation, privation, limitation, finality, mode—nothing
in itself truly real. “Nero’s murder of his mother,
in so far as it had positive content, was no crime. For
Orestes did the same external deed, and had in doing it
the same end in view—to kill his mother; and yet he is
not blamed,” and so on. The affirmative is the will, the
intention, the act of Nero. “Wherein then consists Nero’s
criminality? In nothing else but that he proved himself
ungrateful, merciless, and disobedient. But it is certain
that all this expresses no essence, and therefore God was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
not the cause of it, though He was the cause of Nero’s
action and intention.” These last are something positive,
but yet they do not constitute the crime as such; it is only
the negative element, such as mercilessness, etc. that makes
the action a crime. “We know that whatever exists, regarded
in itself and without taking anything else into
consideration, contains a perfection which extends as
widely as the essence of the thing itself extends, for the
essence is in no way different therefrom.”—“Because then,”
we find in the thirty-second letter (pp. 541, 543), “God
does not regard things abstractly, or form general definitions,”
(of what the thing ought to be) “and no more reality
is required of things than the Divine understanding and
power has given and actually meted out to them; therefore
it clearly follows that such privation exists only and solely in
respect to our understanding, but not in respect to God;”
for God is absolutely real. It is all very well to say this,
but it does not meet the case. For in this way God and
the respect to our understanding are different. Where is
their unity? How is this to be conceived? Spinoza continues
in the thirty-sixth letter: “Although the works of
the righteous (<i>i.e.</i> of those who have a clear idea of God,
to which they direct all their actions and even their
thoughts), and” also the works “of the wicked (<i>i.e.</i> of
those who have no idea of God, but only ideas of earthly
things,”—individual, personal interests and opinions,—“by
which their actions and thoughts are directed), and all
whatsoever exists, necessarily proceed from God’s eternal
laws and counsels, and perpetually depend on God, they
are yet not distinguished from one another in degree, but
in essence; for although a mouse as well as an angel
depends on God, and sorrow as well as joy, yet a mouse
cannot be a kind of angel, and sorrow cannot be a kind of
joy,”—they are different in essence.</p>

<p>There is therefore no ground for the objection that
Spinoza’s philosophy gives the death-blow to morality; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
even gain from it the great result that all that is sensuous is
mere limitation, and that there is only one true substance,
and that human liberty consists in keeping in view this one
substance, and in regulating all our conduct in accordance
with the mind and will of the Eternal One. But in this
philosophy it may with justice be objected that God is conceived
only as Substance, and not as Spirit, as concrete.
The independence of the human soul is therein also denied,
while in the Christian religion every individual appears as
determined to salvation. Here, on the contrary, the individual
spirit is only a mode, an accident, but not anything
substantial. This brings us to a general criticism of the
philosophy of Spinoza, in the course of which we shall consider
it from three different points of view.</p>

<p>In the first place Spinozism is asserted to be Atheism—by
Jacobi, for instance (Werke, Vol. IV. Section I. p. 216)—because
in it no distinction is drawn between God and the
world; it makes nature the real God, or lowers God to the
level of nature, so that God disappears and only nature is
established. But it is not so much God and nature that
Spinoza sets up in mutual opposition, as thought and extension;
and God is unity, not One made up of two, but absolute
Substance, in which has really disappeared the limitation
of the subjectivity of thought and nature. Those who speak
against Spinoza do so as if it were on God’s account that
they were interested; but what these opponents are really
concerned about is not God, but the finite—themselves.
The relationship between God and the finite, to which we
belong, may be represented in three different ways: firstly,
only the finite exists, and in this way we alone exist, but
God does not exist—this is atheism; the finite is here
taken absolutely, and is accordingly the substantial. Or, in
the second place, God alone exists; the finite has no reality,
it is only phenomena, appearance. To say, in the third place,
that God exists and we also exist is a false synthetic union, an
amicable compromise. It is the popular view of the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
that the one side has as much substantiality as the other;
God is honoured and supreme, but finite things also have
Being to exactly the same extent. Reason cannot remain
satisfied with this “also,” with indifference like this. The
philosophic requisite is therefore to apprehend the unity of
these differences in such a way that difference is not let slip,
but proceeds eternally from substance, without being petrified
into dualism. Spinoza is raised above this dualism;
religion is so also, if we turn its popular conceptions into
thoughts. The atheism of the first attitude—when men
set up as ultimate the arbitrariness of the will, their own
vanity, the finite things of nature, and the world dwells for
ever in the mind—is not the standpoint of Spinoza, for
whom God is the one and only substance, the world on the
contrary being merely an affection or mode of this substance.
In the respect that Spinoza does not distinguish God from
the world, the finite, it is therefore correct to term his
theory atheism, for his words are these: Nature, the human
mind, the individual, are God revealed under particular forms.
It has been already remarked (pp. 257, 258, 280) that undoubtedly
Substance with Spinoza does not perfectly fulfil
the conception of God, since it is as Spirit that He is to be
conceived. But if Spinoza is called an atheist for the sole
reason that he does not distinguish God from the world, it
is a misuse of the term. Spinozism might really just as well
or even better have been termed Acosmism, since according
to its teaching it is not to the world, finite existence, the
universe, that reality and permanency are to be ascribed,
but rather to God alone as the substantial. Spinoza maintains
that there is no such thing as what is known as the
world; it is merely a form of God, and in and for itself it is
nothing. The world has no true reality, and all this that we
know as the world has been cast into the abyss of the one
identity. There is therefore no such thing as finite reality, it
has no truth whatever; according to Spinoza what is, is God,
and God alone. Therefore the allegations of those who accuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Spinoza of atheism are the direct opposite of the truth;
with him there is too much God. They say: If God is the
identity of mind and nature, then nature or the individual
man is God. This is quite correct, but they forget that
nature and the individual disappear in this same identity:
and they cannot forgive Spinoza for thus annihilating them.
Those who defame him in such a way as this are therefore
not aiming at maintaining God, but at maintaining the
finite and the worldly; they do not fancy their own
extinction and that of the world. Spinoza’s system is
absolute pantheism and monotheism elevated into thought.
Spinozism is therefore very far removed from being atheism
in the ordinary sense; but in the sense that God is not conceived
as spirit, it is atheism. However, in the same way
many theologians are also atheists who speak of God only
as the Almighty Supreme Being, etc., who refuse to acknowledge
God, and who admit the validity and truth of the
finite. They are many degrees worse than Spinoza.</p>

<p>The second point to be considered is the method
adopted by Spinoza for setting forth his philosophy; it
is the demonstrative method of geometry as employed by
Euclid, in which we find definitions, explanations, axioms,
and theorems. Even Descartes made it his starting-point
that philosophic propositions must be mathematically
handled and proved, that they must have the very same
evidence as mathematics. The mathematical method is
considered superior to all others, on account of the nature
of its evidence; and it is natural that independent knowledge
in its re-awakening lighted first upon this form, of
which it saw so brilliant an example. The mathematical
method is, however, ill-adapted for speculative content,
and finds its proper place only in the finite sciences of the
understanding. In modern times Jacobi has asserted
(Werke, Vol. IV. Section I. pp. 217-223) that all demonstration,
all scientific knowledge leads back to Spinozism,
which alone is a logical method of thought; and because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it must lead thither, it is really of no service whatever, but
immediate knowledge is what we must depend on. It may
be conceded to Jacobi that the method of demonstration
leads to Spinozism, if we understand thereby merely the
method of knowledge belonging to the understanding.
But the fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point
in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said:
You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.
This being so, the mathematical and demonstrative
method of Spinoza would seem to be only a defect in the
external form; but it is the fundamental defect of the
whole position. In this method the nature of philosophic
knowledge and the object thereof, are entirely misconceived,
for mathematical knowledge and method are merely
formal in character and consequently altogether unsuited
for philosophy. Mathematical knowledge exhibits its proof
on the existent object as such, not on the object as conceived;
the Notion is lacking throughout; the content of
Philosophy, however, is simply the Notion and that which
is comprehended by the Notion. Therefore this Notion as
the knowledge of the essence is simply one assumed, which
falls within the philosophic subject; and this is what
represents itself to be the method peculiar to Spinoza’s
philosophy. Of this demonstrative manner we have
already seen these examples: (α) The definitions from
which Spinoza takes his start—as in geometry a commencement
is made with the line, triangle, &amp;c.—concern
universal determinations, such as cause of itself, the finite,
substance, attribute, mode, and so on, which are solely and
simply accepted and assumed, not deduced, nor proved to
be necessary: for Spinoza is not aware of how he arrives at
these individual determinations. (β) He further speaks of
axioms, for instance (Ethic. P. I. Ax. I. p. 36): “What
is, is either in itself or in another.” The determinations
“in itself” and “in another” are not shown forth in
their necessity: neither is this disjunction proved, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
merely assumed. (γ) The propositions have, as such, a
subject and predicate which are not similar. When the
predicate is proved of the subject and necessarily combined
with it, the discrepancy remains that the one as universal is
related to the other as particular: therefore even although
the relation is proved, there is present at the same time a
secondary relation. Mathematical science, in its true
propositions respecting a whole, escapes from the difficulty
by proving also the converse of the propositions, in this
way obtaining for them a special definiteness by proving
each proposition in both ways. True propositions may,
therefore, be looked on as definitions, and the conversion
is the proof of the proposition in the form in which it is
expressed. But this means of escaping the difficulty
Philosophy cannot well employ, since the subject of which
something is proved is itself only the Notion or the
universal, and the proposition form is therefore quite
superfluous and out of place. What has the form of the
subject is in the form of an existent thing, as contrasted
with the universal, the content of the proposition. The existent
thing is taken as signifying existent in the ordinary
sense; it is the word which we use in every-day life,
and of which we have a conception that has nothing of the
Notion in it. The converse of a proposition would simply
read like this: The Notion is that which is thus popularly
conceived. This proof from the usage of language—that
we also understand this to be the meaning in every-day
life, or in other words that the name is correct—has no
philosophic significance. But if the proposition is not one
like this, but an ordinary proposition, and if the predicate
is not the Notion, but some general term or other, a
predicate of the subject, such propositions are really not
philosophic: we might instance the statement that substance
is one and not several, but only that in which
substance and unity are the same. Or, in other words,
this unity of the two moments is the very thing which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
proof has to demonstrate, it is the Notion or the essence.
In this case it looks as if the proposition were the matter
of chief importance, the truth. But if in these really
only so-called propositions, subject and predicate are in
truth not alike, because one is individual and the other
universal, their relation is essential, <i>i.e.</i> the reason for
which they are one. The proof has here a false position
indeed, as if that subject were implicit or in itself,
whereas subject and predicate are, fundamentally even,
moments in separation; in the judgment “God is
One,” the subject itself is universal, since it resolves
itself into unity. On the other side it is implied
in this false position that the proof is brought
in from outside merely, as in mathematics from a preceding
proposition, and that the proposition is not therefore
conceived through itself; thus we see the ordinary
method of proof take its middle term, the principle,
from anywhere it can, in the same way as in classification
it takes its principle of classification. The proposition
is then, as it were, a secondary affair; but we
must ask if this proposition is true. The result as proposition
ought to be truth, but is only knowledge. The
movement of knowledge, as proof, falls therefore, in the
third place, outside of the proposition, which ought to be
the truth. The essential moments of the system are
really already completely contained in the presuppositions
of the definitions, from which all further proofs have merely
to be deduced. But whence have we these categories which
here appear as definitions? We find them doubtless in
ourselves, in scientific culture. The existence of the understanding,
the will, extension, is therefore not developed
from infinite substance, but it is directly expressed in these
determinations, and that quite naturally; for of a truth
there exists the One into which everything enters, in order
to be absorbed therein, but out of which nothing comes.
For as Spinoza has set up the great proposition, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
determination implies negation (<i>supra</i>, p. 267), and as of
everything, even of thought in contrast to extension, it may
be shown that it is determined and finite, what is essential
in it rests upon negation. Therefore God alone is the
positive, the affirmative, and consequently the one substance;
all other things, on the contrary, are only
modifications of this substance, and are nothing in and for
themselves. Simple determination or negation belongs
only to form, but is quite another thing from absolute
determinateness or negativity, which is absolute form; in
this way of looking at it negation is the negation of
negation, and therefore true affirmation. This negative
self-conscious moment, the movement of knowledge, which
pursues its way in the thought which is present before us,
is however certainly lacking to the content of Spinoza’s
philosophy, or at least it is only externally associated with
it, since it falls within self-consciousness. That is to say,
thoughts form the content, but they are not self-conscious
thoughts or Notions: the content signifies thought, as pure
abstract self-consciousness, but an unreasoning knowledge,
into which the individual does not enter: the content has
not the signification of ‘I.’ Therefore the case is as in
mathematics; a proof is certainly given, conviction must
follow, but yet the matter fails to be understood. There is
a rigid necessity in the proof, to which the moment of self-consciousness
is lacking; the ‘I’ disappears, gives itself
altogether up, merely withers away. Spinoza’s procedure
is therefore quite correct; yet the individual proposition
is false, seeing that it expresses only one side of the
negation. The understanding has determinations which
do not contradict one another; contradiction the understanding
cannot suffer. The negation of negation is,
however, contradiction, for in that it negates negation as
simple determination, it is on the one hand affirmation, but
on the other hand also really negation; and this contradiction,
which is a matter pertaining to reason, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
lacking in the case of Spinoza. There is lacking the
infinite form, spirituality and liberty. I have already
mentioned before this (pp. 93, 94; 129-137) that Lullus
and Bruno attempted to draw up a system of form, which
should embrace and comprehend the one substance which
organizes itself into the universe; this attempt Spinoza did
not make.</p>

<p>Because negation was thus conceived by Spinoza in one-sided
fashion merely, there is, in the third place, in his
system, an utter blotting out of the principle of subjectivity,
individuality, personality, the moment of self-consciousness
in Being. Thought has only the signification of the
universal, not of self-consciousness. It is this lack which
has, on the one side, brought the conception of the liberty
of the subject into such vehement antagonism to the
system of Spinoza, because it set aside the independence
of the human consciousness, the so-called liberty which is
merely the empty abstraction of independence, and in
so doing set aside God, as distinguished from nature
and the human consciousness—that is as implicit
or in Himself, in the Absolute; for man has the
consciousness of freedom, of the spiritual, which is the
negative of the corporeal, and man has also the consciousness
that his true Being lies in what is opposed to the
corporeal. This has been firmly maintained by religion,
theology, and the sound common sense of the common
consciousness, and this form of opposition to Spinoza
appears first of all in the assertion that freedom is real, and
that evil exists. But because for Spinoza, on the other
hand, there exists only absolute universal substance as the
non-particularized, the truly real—all that is particular and
individual, my subjectivity and spirituality, has, on the
other hand, as a limited modification whose Notion
depends on another, no absolute existence. Thus the soul,
the Spirit, in so far as it is an individual Being, is for
Spinoza a mere negation, like everything in general that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
determined. As all differences and determinations of
things and of consciousness simply go back into the One
substance, one may say that in the system of Spinoza all
things are merely cast down into this abyss of annihilation.
But from this abyss nothing comes out; and the particular
of which Spinoza speaks is only assumed and presupposed
from the ordinary conception, without being justified.
Were it to be justified, Spinoza would have to deduce it
from his Substance; but that does not open itself out, and
therefore comes to no vitality, spirituality or activity. His
philosophy has only a rigid and unyielding substance, and
not yet spirit; in it we are not at home with ourselves.
But the reason that God is not spirit is that He is not the
Three in One. Substance remains rigid and petrified,
without Boehme’s sources or springs; for the individual
determinations in the form of determinations of the understanding
are not Boehme’s originating spirits, which
energize and expand in one another (<i>supra</i>, pp. 202, 203).
What we find regarding this particular then is that it is
only a modification of absolute substance, which, however,
is not declared to be such; for the moment of negativity is
what is lacking to this rigid motionlessness, whose single
form of activity is this, to divest all things of their determination
and particularity and cast them back into the one
absolute substance, wherein they are simply swallowed up,
and all life in itself is utterly destroyed. This is what we
find philosophically inadequate with Spinoza; distinctions
are externally present, it is true, but they remain external,
since even the negative is not known in itself. Thought is
the absolutely abstract, and for that very reason the absolutely
negative; it is so in truth, but with Spinoza it is not
asserted to be the absolutely negative. But if in opposition
to Spinozism we hold fast to the assertion that Spirit,
as distinguishing itself from the corporeal, is substantial,
actual, true, and in the same way that freedom is not something
merely privative, then this actuality in formal thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
is doubtless correct, yet it rests only upon feeling; but the
further step is that the Idea essentially includes within itself
motion and vitality, and that it consequently has in itself
the principle of spiritual freedom. On the one hand, therefore,
the defect of Spinozism is conceived as consisting in
its want of correspondence with actuality; but on the other
side it is to be apprehended in a higher sense, I mean in
the sense that substance with Spinoza is only the Idea taken
altogether abstractly, not in its vitality.</p>

<p>If, in conclusion, we sum up this criticism that we have
offered, we would say that on the one hand with Spinoza
negation or privation is distinct from substance; for he
merely assumes individual determinations, and does not
deduce them from substance. On the other hand the
negation is present only as Nothing, for in the absolute
there is no mode; the negative is not there, but only its
dissolution, its return: we do not find its movement, its
Becoming and Being. The negative is conceived altogether
as a vanishing moment—not in itself, but only as individual
self-consciousness; it is not like the <i>Separator</i>
we met with in Boehme’s system (<i>supra</i>, p. 206). Self-consciousness
is born from this ocean, dripping with the
water thereof, <i>i.e.</i> never coming to absolute self-hood; the
heart, the independence is transfixed—the vital fire is
wanting. This lack has to be supplied, the moment of
self-consciousness has to be added. It has the following
two special aspects, which we now perceive emerging and
gaining acceptance; in the first place the objective aspect,
that absolute essence obtains in self-consciousness the
mode of an object of consciousness for which the “other”
exists, or the existent as such, and that what Spinoza
understood by the “modes” is elevated to objective reality
as an absolute moment of the absolute; in the second place
we have the aspect of self-consciousness, individuality,
independence. As was formerly the case with respect to
Bacon and Boehme, the former aspect is here taken up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the Englishman, John Locke, the latter by the German
Leibnitz; in the first case it did not appear as a moment,
nor did it in the second appear as absolute Notion. Now
while Spinoza only takes notice of these ordinary conceptions,
and the highest point of view he reaches in regard
to them is that they sink and disappear in the one Substance,
Locke on the contrary examines the genesis of these
conceptions, while Leibnitz opposes to Spinoza the infinite
multiplicity of individuals, although all these monads have
one monad as the basis of their Being. Both Locke and
Leibnitz therefore came forward as opponents of the above-mentioned
one-sidedness of Spinoza.</p>

<h3><a id="c290">3. <span class="smcap">Malebranche.</span></a></h3>

<p>The philosophy of Malebranche is in point of matter
entirely identical with that of Spinoza, but it has another, a
more religious and more theological form; on account of
this form it never encountered the opposition met with by
Spinoza, and for the same reason Malebranche has never
been reproached with Atheism.</p>

<p>Nicholas Malebranche was born at Paris in 1638. He
was sickly and deformed in body, and was hence brought
up with great care. He was diffident and loved solitude;
in his twenty-second year he entered the <i>congrégation de
l’oratoire</i>, a sort of spiritual order, and devoted himself to
the sciences. In passing a bookseller’s shop he happened
accidentally to see Descartes’ work <i>De homine</i>; he read it,
and it interested him greatly—so much so that the reading
of it brought on severe palpitation and he was forced
to cease. This decided his future life; there awoke in him
an irrepressible inclination for Philosophy. He was a man
of most noble and gentle character, and of the most genuine
and unswerving piety. He died at Paris in 1715, and in
the seventy-seventh year of his age.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
His principal work bears the title: <i>De la recherche de la
vérité</i>. One part of it is entirely metaphysical, but the
greater part is altogether empirical. For instance, Malebranche
in the first three books treats logically and
psychologically of the errors in sight and hearing, in the
imagination and understanding.</p>

<p>a. What is most important in this book is his idea of the
origin of our knowledge. He says: “The essence of the soul
is in thought, just as that of matter is in extension. All
else, such as sensation, imagination and will, are modifications
of thought”. He thus begins with two sides, between
which he sets an absolute chasm, and then he follows out
in detail the Cartesian idea of the assistance of God in
knowledge. His main point is that “the soul cannot
attain to its conceptions and notions from external things.”
For when I and the thing are clearly independent of one
another and have nothing in common, the two can certainly
not enter into relation with one another nor be for one
another. “Bodies are impenetrable; their images would
destroy one another on the way to the organs.” But
further: “The soul cannot beget ideas from itself, nor can
they be inborn,” for as “Augustine has said, ‘Say not that
ye yourselves are your own light.’” But how then comes
extension, the manifold, into the simple, into the spirit, since
it is the reverse of the simple, namely the diverse? This
question regarding the association of thought and extension
is always an important one in Philosophy. According to
Malebranche the answer is, “That we see all things in
God.” God Himself is the connection between us and
them, and thus the unity between the thing and thought.
“God has in Him the ideas of all things because He has
created all; God is through His omnipresence united in
the most intimate way with spirits. God thus is the place
of spirits,” the Universal of spirit, “just as space” is the
universal, “the place of bodies. Consequently the soul
knows in God what is in Him,” bodies, “inasmuch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
He sets forth” (inwardly conceives) “created existence,
because all this is spiritual, intellectual, and present to the
soul.”<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Because things and God are intellectual and
we too are intellectual, we perceive them in God as they
are, so to speak, intellectual in Him. If this be further
analyzed it in no way differs from Spinozism. Malebranche
indeed in a popular way allows soul and things to subsist
as independent, but this independence vanishes away like
smoke when the principle is firmly grasped. The
catechism says: “God is omnipresent,” and if this omnipresence
be developed Spinozism is arrived at; and yet
theologians then proceed to speak against the system of
identity, and cry out about Pantheism.</p>

<p>b. We must further remark that Malebranche also makes
the universal, thought, the essential, by placing it before
the particular. “The soul has the Notion of the infinite
and universal: it knows nothing excepting through the
Idea which it has of the infinite; this Idea must hence come
first. The universal is not a mere confusion of individual
ideas, it is not a union of individual things.” According
to Locke the individual from which the universal is formed
precedes (<i>infra</i>, p. 299); according to Malebranche the
universal Idea is what comes first in man. “If we wish to
think of anything particular we think first of the universal;”
it is the principle of the particular, as space is of things.
All essentiality precedes our particular conceptions, and
this essentiality comes first. “All essential existences
(<i>essences</i>) come before our ordinary conception; they cannot
be such excepting by God’s presence in the mind and
spirit. He it is who contains all things in the simplicity of
His nature. It seems evident that mind would not be
capable of representing to itself the universal Notions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
species, kind, and suchlike, if it did not see all things comprehended
in one.” The universal is thus in and for itself,
and it does not take its rise through the particular.
“Since each existent thing is an individual, we cannot say
that we see something actually created when, for example,
we see a triangle in general,” for we see it through God.
“No account can be given of how spirit knows abstract
and common truths, excepting through the presence of Him
who can enlighten spirit in an infinite way,” because He is
in and for Himself the universal. “We have a clear idea
of God,” of the universal: “We can have such only through
union with Him, for this idea is not a created one,” but is
in and for itself. As with Spinoza, the one universal is
God, and in so far as it is determined, it is the particular;
we see this particular only in the universal, as we see bodies
in space. “We already have a conception of infinite
Being, inasmuch as we have a conception of Being without
regard to whether it is finite or infinite. To know a finite
we must limit the infinite; and this last must thus precede.
Thus spirit perceives all in the infinite; this is so far from
being a confused conception of many particular things that
all particular conceptions are merely participations in the
universal Idea of infinitude—in the same way that God
does not receive this Being from” finite “creatures,
but,” on the contrary, “all creatures only subsist through
Him.”<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>c. As regards the turning of the soul to God, Malebranche
says what Spinoza said from his ethical point of view:
“It is impossible that God should have an end other than
Himself (the Holy Scriptures place this beyond doubt);”
the will of God can only have the good, what is without
doubt universal as its end. “Hence not only is it essential
that our natural love, <i>i.e.</i> the emotion which He brings
forth in our spirit, should strive after Him”—“the will is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
really love towards God”—“but it is likewise impossible
that the knowledge and the light which He gives to our
spirit should make anything else known than what is in
Him,” for thought only exists in unity with God. “If
God were to make a spirit and give it the sun as
an idea or as the immediate object of its knowledge, God
would have made this spirit and the idea of this spirit for
the sun and not for Himself.” All natural love, and still
more knowledge, and the desire after truth, have God
as their end. “All motions of the will as regards the
creatures are only determinations of motion as regards
the creator.” Malebranche quotes from Augustine “that
we see God even from the time we first enter upon this
life (<i>dès cette vie</i>), through the knowledge that we have of
eternal truths. The truth is uncreated, unchangeable, immeasurable,
eternal above all things; it is true through
itself, and has its perfection from no thing. It makes the
creator more perfect, and all spirits naturally seek to
know it: now there is nothing that has these perfections
but God, and thus the truth is God. We perceive these
unchangeable and eternal truths, hence we see God.”
“God indeed sees but He does not feel sensuous things.
If we see something sensuous, sensation and pure thought
are to be found in our consciousness. Sensation is a modification
of our spirit; God occasions this because He knows
that our soul is capable of it. The Idea which is bound
up with the sensation is in God; we see it, etc. This
relation, this union of our mind and spirit with the Word
(<i>Verbe</i>) of God, and of our will with His love, is that we
are formed after the image of God and in His likeness.”<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
Thus the love of God consists in relating one’s affections to
the Idea of God; whoever knows himself and thinks his
affections clearly, loves God. We further find sundry empty
litanies concerning God, a catechism for children of eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
years of age respecting goodness, justice, omnipresence, the
moral order of the world; in all their lifetime theologians
do not get any further.</p>

<p>We have given the principal of Malebranche’s ideas;
the remainder of his philosophy is composed partly of
formal logic, and partly of empirical psychology. He
passes to the treatment of errors, how they arise, how the
senses, the imagination, the understanding, deceive us,
and how we must conduct ourselves in order to effect a
remedy. Then Malebranche goes on (T. III. L. VI. P.
I. chap. i. pp. 1-3) to the rules and laws for recognizing the
truth. Thus here the term Philosophy was even applied to
the manner in which reflections on particular objects are
drawn from formal logic and external facts.</p>

<p>It was Locke who became the instrument of setting forth
this entire manner of thinking in a systematic way, for he
worked out Bacon’s position more fully. And if Bacon made
sensuous Being to be the truth, Locke demonstrated the universal,
Thought, to be present in sensuous Being, or showed
that we obtained the universal, the true, from experience.
From Locke a wide culture proceeds, influencing English
philosophers more especially; the forms adopted by this
school were various, but the principle was the same; it
became a general method of regarding things in a popular
way, and calls itself Philosophy, although the object of
Philosophy is not to be met with here.</p>

<h3><a id="c295b">1. <span class="smcap">Locke.</span></a></h3>

<p>When experience means that the Notion has objective
actuality for consciousness, it is indeed a necessary element
in the totality; but as this reflection appears in Locke,
signifying as it does that we obtain truth by abstraction
from experience and sensuous perception, it is utterly false,
since, instead of being a moment, it is made the essence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the truth. It is no doubt true that against the hypothesis of
the inward immediacy of the Idea, and against the method
of setting it forth in definitions and axioms, as also against
absolute substance, the demand that ideas should be represented
as results, and the claims of individuality and self-consciousness,
assert their rights to recognition. In the
philosophy of Locke and Leibnitz, however, these necessities
make themselves known in an imperfect manner
only; the one fact which is common to both philosophers is
that they, in opposition to Spinoza and Malebranche, take
for their principle the particular, finite determinateness
and the individual. According to Spinoza and Malebranche
substance or the universal is the true, the sole existent, the
eternal, that which is in and for itself, without origin, and
of which particular things are only modifications which
are conceived through substance. But hereby Spinoza has
done an injury to this negative; he hence arrived at no
immanent determination, for all that is determined and
individual is merely annihilated in his system. Now, on
the contrary, the general inclination of consciousness is to
maintain the difference, partly in order to mark itself
out as implicitly free in opposition to its object—Being,
nature, and God, and partly in order to recognize the
unity in this opposition, and from the opposition itself to
make the unity emerge. But those who were the instruments
of this tendency comprehended themselves but little,
they had still no clear consciousness of their task, nor of
the manner in which their claims could be satisfied. With
Locke, this principle makes its first entrance into Philosophy
in a manner so completely at variance with the inflexible
undifferentiated identity of the substance of Spinoza, that
the sensuous and limited, the immediate present and existent,
is the main and fundamental matter. Locke does not get
beyond the ordinary point of view of consciousness, viz.
that objects outside of us are the real and the true. The
finite is thus not grasped by Locke as absolute negativity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i> in its infinitude; this we shall not find until we come
to deal in the third place with Leibnitz. It is in a higher
sense that Leibnitz asserts individuality, the differentiated,
to be self-existent and indeed objectless, to be true Being.
That is to say, it is not according to him finite, but is yet
distinguished; thus, each monad is itself the totality.
Leibnitz and Locke hence likewise stand in a position of
mutual independence and antagonism.</p>

<p>John Locke was born in 1632, at Wrington, in England.
He studied for himself the Cartesian philosophy at Oxford,
setting aside the scholastic philosophy which was still in
vogue. He devoted himself to the study of medicine, which,
however, on account of his delicate health, he never really
practised. In 1664 he went with an English ambassador
for a year to Berlin. After his return to England, he
became acquainted with the intellectual Earl of Shaftesbury
of that time, who availed himself of his medical advice,
and in whose house he lived without requiring to give himself
up to practice. When Lord Shaftesbury became Lord
Chancellor of England, Locke received an office from him,
which, however, he soon lost by a change of ministry.
Owing to his dread of falling a prey to consumption, he betook
himself in 1675 to Montpellier for the benefit of his health.
When his patron came into power again he once more
recovered the place he had lost, only to be again deposed on
a fresh overthrow of this minister, and he was now compelled
to flee from England. “The act by means of which
Locke was driven from Oxford” (what post he held there we
are not told) “was not an enactment of the University, but
of James II., by whose express command, and by the peremptory
authority of a written warrant, the expulsion was
carried out. From the correspondence that took place, it
is evident that the college submitted itself against its will
to a measure which it could not resist without compromising
the peace and quiet of its members.” Locke went to
Holland, which was at that time the land wherein all who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
were obliged to effect their escape from any oppression,
whether political or religious, found protection, and in which
the most famous and liberal-minded men were to be met
with. The Court party persecuted him even here, and by
royal warrant he was ordered to be taken prisoner and
sent to England; consequently he had to remain hidden
with his friends. When William of Orange ascended the
English throne, after the Revolution of 1688, Locke
returned with him to England. He was there made Commissioner
of Trade and Plantations, gave to the world his
famous treatise on the Human Understanding, and finally,
having withdrawn from public office on account of the
delicacy of his health, he spent his remaining years in the
country houses of English nobles; he died on the 28th day
of October, 1704, in the seventy-third year of his life.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The philosophy of Locke is much esteemed; it is still,
for the most part, the philosophy of the English and the
French, and likewise in a certain sense of the Germans.
To put it in a few words, it asserts on the one hand that
truth and knowledge rest upon experience and observation;
and on the other the analysis of and abstraction from
general determinations is prescribed as the method of
knowledge; it is, so to speak, a metaphysical empiricism,
and this is the ordinary method adopted in the sciences. In
respect of method, Locke thus employs an exactly opposite
system to that of Spinoza. In the methods of Spinoza and
Descartes an account of the origin of ideas may be dispensed
with; they are accepted at once as definitions,
such as those of substance, the infinite, mode, extension,
etc., all of which constitute a quite incoherent list. But we
require to show where these thoughts come in, on what they
are founded, and how they are verified. Thus Locke has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
striven to satisfy a true necessity. For he has the merit of
having deserted the system of mere definitions, which were
before this made the starting point, and of having attempted
to make deduction of general conceptions, inasmuch as he
was, for example, at the pains to show how substantiality
arises subjectively from objects. That is a further step
than any reached by Spinoza, who begins at once with
definitions and axioms which are unverified. Now they are
derived, and no longer oracularly laid down, even if the
method and manner whereby this authentication is established
is not the right one. That is to say, here the matter
in question is merely subjective, and somewhat psychological,
since Locke merely describes the methods of mind as
it appears to us to be. For in his philosophy we have
more especially to deal with the derivation of the general
conceptions, or ideas, as he called them, that are present in
our knowledge, and with their origin as they proceed from
what is outwardly and inwardly perceptible. Malebranche
no doubt likewise asks how we arrive at conceptions, and
thus he apparently has before him the same subject of investigation
as has Locke. But firstly, this psychological
element in Malebranche is merely the later development,
and then to him the universal or God is plainly first, while
Locke commences at once with individual perceptions, and
only from them does he proceed to Notions, to God. The
universal to Locke is, therefore, merely a later result, the
work of our minds; it is simply something pertaining to
thought, as subjective. Every man undoubtedly knows
that when his consciousness develops empirically, he commences
from feelings, from quite concrete conditions, and
that it is only later on that general conceptions come in,
which are connected with the concrete of sensation by
being contained therein. Space, for example, comes to
consciousness later than the spacial, the species later than
the individual; and it is only through the activity of my
consciousness that the universal is separated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
particular of conception, feeling, etc. Feeling undoubtedly
comes lowest, it is the animal mode of spirit; but in its
capacity as thinking, spirit endeavours to transform feeling
into its own form. Thus the course adopted by Locke is
quite a correct one, but all dialectic considerations are
utterly and entirely set aside, since the universal is merely
analyzed from the empirical concrete. And in this matter
Kant reproaches Locke with reason, the individual is not
the source of universal conceptions, but the understanding.</p>

<p>As to Locke’s further reflections, they are very simple.
Locke considers how the understanding is only consciousness,
and in being so is something in consciousness, and
he only recognizes the implicit in as far as it is in the
same.</p>

<p>a. Locke’s philosophy is more especially directed against
Descartes, who, like Plato, had spoken of innate ideas.
Locke likewise makes special examination of the “inborn
impressions (<i>notiones communes in foro interiori descriptæ</i>)”
which Lord Herbert assumes in his work <i>De veritate</i>. In
the first book of his work Locke combats the so-called
innate ideas, theoretic as well as practical, <i>i.e.</i> the universal,
absolutely existent ideas which at the same time are represented
as pertaining to mind in a natural way. Locke said
that we arrive first at <i>that</i> which we call idea. By this he
understands not the essential determinations of man, but
conceptions which we have and which are present and exist
in consciousness as such: in the same way we all have arms
and legs as parts of our bodies, and the desire to eat
exists in everyone. In Locke we thus have the conception
of the soul as of a contentless <i>tabula rasa</i> which is by-and-by
filled with what we call experience.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> The expression
“innate principles” was at that time common, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
innate principles have sometimes been foolishly spoken of.
But their true signification is that they are implicit, that
they are essential moments in the nature of thought, qualities
of a germ, which do not yet exist: only in relation to this
last there is an element of truth in Locke’s conclusions.
As diverse conceptions essentially determined they are only
legitimatized by its being shown that they are implied in the
essential nature of thought; but as propositions which hold
good as axioms, and conceptions which are immediately accepted
as laid down in definitions, they undoubtedly possess
the form of that which is present and inborn. As they are
regarded they are bound to have value in and for themselves;
but this is a mere assertion. From the other
point of view the question of whence they come is a futile
one. Mind is undoubtedly determined in itself, for it is
the explicitly existent Notion; its development signifies the
coming to consciousness. But the determinations which it
brings forth from itself cannot be called innate, for this
development must be occasioned by an external, and only
on that does the activity of mind react, in order that it may
for the first time become conscious of its reality.</p>

<p>The grounds on which Locke refutes innate ideas are
empirical. “There is nothing more commonly taken for
granted than that there are certain principles, both speculative
and practical, universally agreed upon by all mankind:
which therefore, they argue, must needs be constant impressions
which the souls of men receive in their first Beings.”
But this universal consent is not to be found. We may
instance the proposition, “Whatsoever is, is; and It is impossible
for the same thing to be and not to be; which of
all others I think have the most allowed title to innate.”
But this proposition does not hold good for the Notion;
there is nothing either in heaven or earth which does not
contain Being and non-Being. Many men, “All children
and idiots,” says Locke, “have not the least apprehension
of these propositions.” “No proposition can be said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in the mind which it never yet knew, which it was never
yet conscious of.... ’Tis usually answered, That all men
know and assent to them” (the propositions) “when they
come to the use of reason.... If it be meant that the use
of reason assists us in the knowledge of these maxims, it
would prove them not to be innate.” Reason is said to be
the deriving from principles already known unknown truths.
How then should the application of reason be required to
discover supposed innate principles? This is a weak objection,
for it assumes that by innate ideas we understand those
which man possesses in consciousness as immediately present.
But development in consciousness is something altogether
different from any inherent determination of reason, and
therefore the expression innate idea is undoubtedly quite
wrong. Innate principles must be found “clearest and
most perspicuous nearest the fountain, in children and
illiterate people, who have received least impression from
foreign opinion.” Locke gives further reasons of a similar
nature, more especially employing those which are of a
practical kind—the diversity in moral judgments, the case
of those who are utterly wicked and depraved, devoid of
sense of right or conscience.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>b. In the second book Locke goes on to the next stage,
to the origin of ideas, and seeks to demonstrate this process
from experience—this is the main object of his efforts. The
reason that the positive point of view which he opposes to
any derivation from within, is so false, is that he derives
his conceptions only from outside and thus maintains Being-for-another,
while he quite neglects the implicit. He says:
“Every man being conscious to himself, that he thinks;
and that which his mind is applied about, while thinking,
being the ideas that are there; ’tis past doubt, that men
have in their minds several ideas, such as those expressed
in the words, whiteness, hardness, sweetness, thinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
motion, man, elephant, army, drunkenness, and others.”
Idea here signifies both the ordinary conception and thought;
we understand something quite different by the word idea.
“It is in the first place then to be inquired, how he comes
by them” (these ideas)? Innate ideas have already been
refuted. “Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we
say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas;
how comes it to be furnished?... To this I answer in a
word, from Experience: in that all our knowledge is
founded.”<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>As to the question in point we must in the first place say
that it is true that man commences with experience if he
desires to arrive at thought. Everything is experienced, not
merely what is sensuous, but also what excites and stimulates
my mind. Consciousness thus undoubtedly obtains all
conceptions and Notions from experience and in experience;
the only question is what we understand by experience.
In a usual way when this is spoken of the idea of nothing
particular is conveyed; we speak of it as of something
quite well known. But experience is nothing more than
the form of objectivity; to say that it is something which
is in consciousness means that it has objective form for
consciousness or that consciousness experiences it, it sees it
as an objective. Experience thus signifies immediate knowledge,
perception, <i>i.e.</i> I myself must have and be something,
and the consciousness of what I have and am is
experience. Now there is no question as to this, that
whatever we know, of whatever kind it may be, must be
experienced, that rests in the conception of the thing. It
is absurd to say that one knows anything which is not in
experience. I undoubtedly know men, for instance, from
experience, without requiring to have seen them all, for I
have, as man, activity and will, a consciousness respecting
what I am and what others are. The rational exists, <i>i.e.</i> it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
is as an existent for consciousness, or this last experiences
it; it must be seen and heard, it must be there or have been
there as a phenomenon in the world. This connection of
universal with objective is however in the second place not
the only form, that of the implicit is likewise absolute and
essential—that is, the apprehension of what is experienced
or the abrogation of this apparent other-being and the
knowledge of the necessity of the thing through itself. It
is now quite a matter of indifference whether anything is
accepted as something experienced, as a succession of
empirical ideas, if one may so say, or conceptions; or
whether the succession is a succession of thoughts, <i>i.e.</i>
implicitly existent.</p>

<p>Locke treats of the various kinds of these ideas imperfectly
and empirically merely.</p>

<p>α. According to Locke simple ideas arise partly from
outward, and partly from inward experience. For experiences,
he says, are in the first place sensations; the other
side is reflection, the inward determinations of consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
From sensation, from the organs of sight for instance,
the conceptions of colour, light, etc., arise; there
further arises from outward experience the idea of impenetrability,
of figure, rest, motion and such like. From
reflections come the ideas of faith, doubt, judgment, reasoning,
thinking, willing, etc.; from both combined, pleasure,
pain, etc. This is a very commonplace account of the
matter.</p>

<p>β. After Locke has presupposed experience, he goes on
to say that it is the understanding which now discovers
and desires the universal—the complex ideas. The Bishop
of Worcester made the objection that “If the idea of
substance be grounded upon plain and evident reason, then
we must allow an idea of substance which comes not in by
sensation or reflection.” Locke replies: “General ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
come not into the mind by sensation or reflection, but are
the creatures or inventions of the understanding. The
mind makes them from ideas which it has got by sensation
and reflection.” The work of the mind now consists in
bringing forth from several simple so-called ideas a number
of new ones, by means of its working upon this material
through comparing, distinguishing and contrasting it,
and finally through separation or abstraction, whereby the
universal conceptions, such as space, time, existence, unity
and diversity, capacity, cause and effect, freedom, necessity,
take their rise. “The mind in respect of its simple ideas
is wholly passive, and receives them all from the existence
and operation of things, such as sensation or reflection
offers them, without being able to make any one idea.”
But “the mind often exercises an active power in making
these several combinations. For it being once furnished
with simple ideas it can put them together in several
combinations.” According to Locke therefore thought
itself is not the essence of the soul, but one of its powers
and manifestations. He maintains thought to be existent
in consciousness as conscious thought, and thus brings it
forward as a fact in his experience, that we do not always
think. Experience demonstrates dreamless sleep when the
sleep is profound. Locke quotes the example of a man
who remembered no dream until he had reached his
twenty-fifth year. It is as in the Xenien,—<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">Oft schon war ich, und hab’ wirklich an gar nichts gedacht.</p>

<p>That is to say, my object is not a thought. But
sensuous perception and recollection are thought, and
thought is truth.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Locke, however, places the reality
of the understanding only in the formal activity of
constituting new determinations from the simple conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
received by means of perception, through their
comparison and the combination of several into one; it is
the apprehension of the abstract sensations which are contained
in the objects. Locke likewise distinguishes (Bk. II.
chap. xi. § 15-17) between pure and mixed modes. Pure
modes are simple determinations such as power, number,
infinitude; in such expressions as causality we reach, on
the other hand, a mixed mode.</p>

<p>Locke now explains in detail the manner in which the
mind, from the simple ideas of experience, reaches more
complex ideas; but this derivation of general determinations
from concrete perception is most unmeaning, trivial, tiresome
and diffuse; it is entirely formal, an empty tautology.
For instance we form the general conception of space from
the perception of the distance of bodies by means of sight
and feeling.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Or in other words, we perceive a definite
space, abstract from it, and then we have the conception of
space generally; the perception of distances gives us conceptions
of space. This however is no deduction, but only
a setting aside of other determinations; since distance
itself is really space, mind thus determines space from
space. Similarly we reach the notion of time through the
unbroken succession of conceptions during our waking
moments,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> <i>i.e.</i> from determinate time we perceive time
in general. Conceptions follow one another in a continual
succession; if we set aside the particular element that
is present we thereby receive the conception of time.
Substance (which Locke does not accept in so lofty a sense
as Spinoza), a complex idea, hence arises from the
fact that we often perceive simple ideas such as blue,
heavy, etc., in association with one another. This association
we represent to ourselves as something which so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
speak supports these simple ideas, or in which they exist.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Locke likewise deduces the general conception of power.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
The determinations of freedom and necessity, cause and
effect, are then derived in a similar way. “In the notice
that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of things,
we cannot but observe, that several particulars, both
qualities and substance, begin to exist; and that they
receive this their existence from the due application and
operation of some other being. From this observation we
get our ideas of cause and effect,” for instance when wax
is melted by the fire.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Locke goes on to say: “Every one,
I think, finds in himself a power to begin or forbear,
continue or put an end to several actions in himself. From
the consideration of the extent of this power of the mind
over the actions of the man, which every one finds in
himself, arise the ideas of liberty and necessity.”<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>We may say that nothing can be more superficial than
this derivation of ideas. The matter itself, the essence, is
not touched upon at all. A determination is brought into
notice which is contained in a concrete relationship; hence
the understanding on the one hand abstracts and on the
other establishes conclusions. The basis of this philosophy
is merely to be found in the transference of the determinate
to the form of universality, but it was just this fundamental
essence that we had to explain. As to this Locke confesses
of space, for example, that he does not know what it really is.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
This so-called analysis by Locke of complex conceptions,
and his so-called explanation of the same, has, on account
of its uncommon clearness and lucidity of expression, found
universal acceptance. For what can be clearer than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
say that we have the notion of time because we perceive
time, if we do not actually see it, and that we conceive of
space because we see it? The French have accepted this
most readily and they have carried it further still; their
<i>Idéologie</i> contains nothing more nor less.</p>

<p>γ. When Locke starts by saying that everything is
experience and we abstract for ourselves from this experience
general conceptions regarding objects and their
qualities, he makes a distinction in respect of external
qualities which was before this made by Aristotle (De
anima, II. 6), and which we likewise met with in Descartes
(<i>supra</i>, pp. 245, 246). That is to say, Locke distinguishes
between primary and secondary qualities; the first pertain
to the objects themselves in truth, the others are not real
qualities, but are founded on the nature of the organs of
sensation. Primary qualities are mechanical, like extension,
solidity, figure, movement, rest; these are qualities of the
corporeal, just as thought is the quality of the spiritual.
But the determinations of our individual feelings such as
colours, sounds, smells, taste, etc., are not primary.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> In
Descartes’ case this distinction has however another form,
for the second class of these determinations is defined by
him in such a way as that they do not constitute the
essence of body, while Locke says that they exist for
sensation, or fall within existence as it is for consciousness.
Locke, however, no doubt reckons figure, etc., as still pertaining
to reality, but by so doing nothing is ascertained as
to the nature of body. In Locke a difference here appears
between the implicit and being ‘for-another,’ in which he
declares the moment of ‘for-another’ to be unreal—and
yet he sees all truth in the relation of ‘for-another’ only.</p>

<p>c. Since the universal as such, the idea of species, is,
according to Locke, merely a product of our mind, which is
not itself objective, but relates merely to objects which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
germane to it, and from which the particular of qualities,
conditions, time, place, etc., are separated, Locke distinguishes
essences into real essences and nominal essences;
the former of these express the true essence of things, while
species on the other hand are mere nominal essences which
no doubt express something which is present in the objects,
but which do not exhaust these objects. They serve to
distinguish species for our knowledge, but the real essence
of nature we do not know.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Locke gives good reasons for
species being nothing in themselves—for their not being in
nature, or absolutely determined—instancing in exemplification
the production of monstrosities (Bk. III. chap. iii.
§ 17): were species absolute no monster would be born.
But he overlooks the fact that since it pertains to species
to exist, it thereby likewise enters into relationship with
other determinations; thus that is the sphere in which
individual things operate upon one another, and may hence
be detrimental to the existence of the species. Locke thus
argues just as one would who wished to prove that the good
does not exist in itself, because there are likewise evil men,
that the circle does not exist absolutely in nature, because
the circumference of a tree, for example, represents a very
irregular circle, or because I draw a circle badly. Nature
just signifies the lack of power to be perfectly adequate to
the Notion; it is only in spirit that the Notion has its true
existence. To say that species are nothing in themselves,
that the universal is not the essential reality of nature, that
its implicit existence is not the object of thought, is tantamount
to saying that we do not know real existence: it is
the same litany which has since been so constantly repeated
that we are tired of listening to it:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">Das Innere der Natur kennt kein erschaffener Geist,</p>

<p class="noindent">and which goes on until we have perceived that Being-for-another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
perception, is not implicit; a point of view
which has not made its way to the positive position that the
implicit is the universal. Locke is far back in the nature
of knowledge, further back than Plato, because of his
insistence on Being-for-another.</p>

<p>It is further noteworthy that from the sound understanding
Locke argues (Vol. III. Bk. IV. chap. vii. § 8-11)
against universal propositions or axioms such as that
A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A, <i>i.e.</i> if anything is A it cannot be B. He says
they are superfluous, of very little use or of no use at all, for
nobody yet has built up a science on a proposition which
asserts a contradiction. From such the true may be
proved as easily as the false; they are tautological. What
Locke has further achieved in respect of education, toleration,
natural rights or universal state-right, does not
concern us here, but has to do with general culture.</p>

<p>This is the philosophy of Locke, in which there is no
trace of speculation. The great end of Philosophy, which
is to know the truth, is in it sought to be attained in an
empiric way; it thus indeed serves to draw attention to
general determinations. But such a philosophy not only
represents the standpoint of ordinary consciousness, to which
all the determinations of its thought appear as if given, humble
as it is in the oblivion of its activity, but in this method
of derivation and psychological origination that which
alone concerns Philosophy, the question of whether these
thoughts and relationships have truth in and for themselves,
is not present at all, inasmuch as the only object
aimed at is to describe the manner in which thought
accepts what is given to it. It may be held with Wolff
that it is arbitrary to begin with concrete conceptions,
as when our conception of identity is made to take its
origin from such things as blue flowers and the blue
heavens. One can better begin directly from universal
conceptions and say that we find in our consciousness the
conceptions of time, cause and effect; these are the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
facts of consciousness. This method forms the basis of the
Wolffian system of reasoning, only here we must still distinguish
amongst the different conceptions those that are
to be regarded as most essential; in Locke’s philosophy,
this distinction cannot really be said to come under consideration.
From this time, according to Locke, or in this
particular aspect of Philosophy, there is a complete and
entire change in the point of view adopted; the whole
interest is limited to the form in which the objective, or individual
sensations, pass into the form of conceptions. In
the case of Spinoza and Malebranche, we undoubtedly likewise
saw that it was made a matter of importance to recognize
this relation of thought to what is sensuously perceived,
and thus to know it as falling into relation, as passing into
the relative; the main question hence was: How are the two
related? But the question was answered to the effect that
it is only this relation for itself that constitutes the point
of interest, and this relation itself as absolute substance is
thus identity, the true, God, it is not the related parts. The
interest does not lie in the related parts; the related parts
as one-sided are not the existent, presupposed and permanently
established, they are accidental merely. But here
the related sides, the things and the subject, have their
proper value, and they are presupposed as having this
value. Locke’s reasoning is quite shallow; it keeps entirely
to the phenomenal, to that which is, and not to that
which is true.</p>

<p>There is another question however: Are these general
determinations absolutely true? And whence come they
not alone into my consciousness, into my mind and understanding,
but into the things themselves? Space, cause,
effect, etc., are categories. How do these categories come
into the particular? How does universal space arrive at
determining itself? This point of view, the question
whether these determinations of the infinite, of substance,
etc., are in and for themselves true, is quite lost sight of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Plato investigated the infinite and the finite, Being and the
determinate, etc., and pronounced that neither of these
opposites is of itself true; they are so only as together
constituting an identity, wherever the truth of this content
may come from. But here the truth as it is in and for itself
is entirely set aside and the nature of the content itself
is made the main point. It does not matter whether the
understanding or experience is its source, for the question
is whether this content is in itself true. With Locke, the
truth merely signifies the harmony of our conceptions with
things; here relation is alone in question, whether the content
is an objective thing or a content of the ordinary conception.
But it is quite another matter to investigate the
content itself, and to ask, “Is this which is within us true?”
We must not dispute about the sources, for the Whence, the
only important point to Locke, does not exhaust the whole
question. The interest of the content in and for itself
wholly disappears when that position is taken up, and
thereby the whole of what is aimed at by Philosophy is given
up. On the other hand, when thought is from the beginning
concrete, when thought and the universal are synonymous
with what is set before us, the question of the relation
of the two which have been separated by thought is destitute
of interest and incomprehensible. How does thought
overcome the difficulties which itself has begotten? Here
with Locke none at all have been begotten and awakened.
Before the need for reconciliation can be satisfied, the pain
of disunion must be excited.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Locke is certainly very comprehensible,
but for that very reason it is likewise a popular philosophy
to which the whole of the English philosophy as it
exists at this day is allied; it is the thinking method of
regarding things which is called philosophy carried to its
perfection, the form which was introduced into the science
which then took its rise in Europe. This is an important
moment in culture; the sciences in general and specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the empiric sciences have to ascribe their origin to this
movement. To the English, Philosophy has ever signified
the deduction of experiences from observations; this has in
a one-sided way been applied to physical and economic subjects.
General principles of political economy such as
free-trade in the present day, and all matters which rest on
thinking experience, the knowledge of whatever reveals
itself in this sphere as necessary and useful, signifies philosophy
to the English (Vol. I. pp. 57, 58). The scholastic
method of starting from principles and definitions has been
rejected. The universal, laws, forces, universal matter, etc.,
have in natural science been derived from perceptions; thus
to the English, Newton is held to be the philosopher κατ’
ἐξοχήν. The other side is that in practical philosophy regarding
society or the state, thought applies itself to concrete
objects such as the will of the prince, subjects and their
ends and personal welfare. Inasmuch as we have an object
such as that before us, the indwelling and essential
universal is made evident; it must, however, be made clear
which conception is the one to which the others must yield.
It is in this way that rational politics took their rise in
England, because the institutions and government peculiar
to the English led them specially and in the first place to
reflection upon their inward political and economic relationships.
Hobbes must be mentioned as an exemplification
of this fact. This manner of reasoning starts from the
present mind, from what is our own, whether it be within
or without us, since the feelings which we have, the experiences
which fall directly within us, are the principles.
This philosophy of reasoning thought is that which has
now become universal, and through which the whole revolution
in the position taken up by mind has come to pass.</p>

<h3><a id="c313">2. <span class="smcap">Hugo Grotius.</span></a></h3>

<p>Hugo Grotius was studying the laws of nations at the
same time as Locke; and in him the very same methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
may be found as those already mentioned, inasmuch as he
also falls into a quite empirical system of associating
nations with one another, combining with that an empirical
mode of reasoning. Hugo van Groot, born 1583 at Delft,
was a lawyer, fiscal general, and council pensionary; in
1619, however, he was implicated in the Barneveldt trial,
and was compelled to fly the country. For a long time he
remained in France, but in 1634 he entered the service of
Queen Christina of Sweden. In 1635 he was made Swedish
ambassador in Paris, and in 1645 he died at Rostock, while
on a journey from Stockholm to Holland.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> His principal
work, <i>De jure belli et pacis</i>, he composed in 1625; now it
is not read, but at one time it exercised a very great and
important influence. In it Grotius presented a comparative
historical account, the material of which was partly
derived from the Old Testament, of the manner in which
nations in the various relationships of war and peace have
acted towards one another, and what usages they held to
be binding. The following may serve as an example of his
empirical method of reasoning: Prisoners ought not to be
killed; for the object is to disarm the enemy, and if this
end be attained nothing further should be done.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> This
empirical way of connecting facts had the effect of bringing
general comprehensible and rational principles into consciousness,
of making them recognized, and of causing them
to be more or less acceptable. Thus we see principles set
forth, respecting the righteousness of a king’s power for
instance; for thought applied itself to everything. We
are unsatisfied by such proofs and deductions, but we must
not overlook what is thereby accomplished; and this is the
establishment of principles which have their ultimate
confirmation in the objects themselves, in mind and
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="c315">3. <span class="smcap">Thomas Hobbes.</span></a></h3>

<p>Hobbes, who was celebrated and distinguished on
account of the originality of his views, was tutor to the
Earl of Devonshire; he was born in 1588 at Malmesbury,
and died in 1679.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> As a contemporary of Cromwell, he
found in the events of that time, in the Revolution which
then took place in England, an occasion for reflecting on
the principles of state and law, and in fact he succeeded in
making his way to quite original conceptions. He wrote
much, including a treatise on Philosophy, entitled “The
Elements of Philosophy.” The first section (<i>Sectio</i>) of this
work, <i>De corpore</i>, appeared in London in 1655; in it he
first of all treats of Logic (<i>Pars</i> I.), and secondly of
<i>philosophia prima</i> (<i>Pars</i> II.); this last is an ontology and
metaphysic. The next sub-division (<i>Pars</i> III.), “On the
relation between motion and magnitude,” is a system of
mechanism, a quite popular system of physics; and a study
of the human organs. The second section was to treat of
the nature of man (<i>De homine</i>), and the third of the state
(<i>De cive</i>), but the intellectual sections of the work Hobbes
did not entirely finish. He says in his preface that Copernicus
first opened up astronomy, and Galileo physics, before
them there was nothing certain in either science. Harvey
worked out the science of the human body, and physics
generally as well as astronomy were perfected by Keppler.
All this was termed Philosophy, in accordance with the point
of view which has been already given (p. 313), since in it
the reflective understanding desires to know the universal.
Hobbes further says concerning the philosophy of the state
(<i>philosophia civilis</i>), that it only dates from the publication
of his book <i>De cive</i>.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> This work, which appeared at Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
in 1642,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> is, like his Leviathan, a much decried book; the
second mentioned writing was forbidden to be circulated,
and is hence very rare. Both works contain sounder
reflections on the nature of society and government than
many now in circulation. Society, the state, is to Hobbes
absolutely pre-eminent, it is the determining power without
appeal as regards law and positive religion and their
external relations; and because he placed these in subjection
to the state, his doctrines were of course regarded
with the utmost horror. But there is nothing speculative
or really philosophic in them, and there is still less in Hugo
Grotius.</p>

<p>Before this ideals were set before us, or Holy Scripture
or positive law was quoted as authoritative. Hobbes, on
the contrary, sought to derive the bond which holds the
state together, that which gives the state its power, from
principles which lie within us, which we recognize as our
own. In this way two opposite principles arise. The first
is the passive obedience of subjects, the divine authority of
rulers, whose will is absolute law, and is itself elevated
above all other law. All this is represented in close connection
with religion, and proved by examples from the
Old Testament, by such stories as those of Saul and David.
Criminal and marriage laws, too, for long derived their
character from the Mosaic laws, or, speaking generally,
from those the provisions of which possessed their value by
the fact of being established by express divine command.
On the other hand we have in the second place the
reasoning wherein we ourselves are the determining agents,
and which was called sound reason. In the movement
which Cromwell made use of there was allied with this a
fanaticism, which from the written letter drew opposite
conclusions to the above, and this we see exemplified
in the equality of property, for instance. Hobbes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
it is true, likewise maintained passive obedience, the
absolute freedom of the royal will and power; but at
the same time he sought to derive the principles of
monarchical power, etc., from universal determinations.
The views that he adopts are shallow and empirical, but the
reasons he gives for them, and the propositions he makes
respecting them, are original in character, inasmuch as
they are derived from natural necessities and wants.</p>

<p>Hobbes maintained that “The origin of all society is to
be found in the mutual fear of all its members;” it is hence
a phenomenon in consciousness. “Each association is thus
formed in its own interest or for its own renown, that is,
from selfish motives.” All such matters as security of life,
property, and enjoyment, are not to be found outside it.
“But men have in all dissimilarity of strength a natural
similarity as well.” This Hobbes proves by a characteristic
reason, viz. that “each individual can make away with the
other,” each is the ultimate power over the others. “Each
can be supreme.”<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Thus their similarity is not derived
from the greatest strength; it is not, as in modern times,
founded on the freedom of the spirit, or on an equality of
merit and independence, but on the equal weakness of mankind;
each man is weak as regards others.</p>

<p>b. Hobbes further takes up the position that this natural
condition is of such a nature that all possess the desire to
rule over one another. “All in their natural condition are
possessed of the will to injure others,” to tyrannize over
other men; each has thus to fear the other. Hobbes looks
at this condition in its true light, and we find in him no
idle talk about a state of natural goodness; the natural
condition is really far more like that of the animals—a
condition in which there is an unsubdued individual will.
All thus wish to “secure themselves against the pretensions
of others, to acquire for themselves advantages and superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
rights. Opinions, religions, desires, arouse strife; the
stronger bears away the victory. The natural condition is
consequently a condition of mistrust on the part of all
towards all; it is a war of all against all (<i>bellum omnium
in omnes</i>),” and the endeavour of one to overreach another.
The expression nature has a double significance: In the
first place the nature of man signifies his spiritual and
rational Being; but his natural condition indicates quite
another condition, wherein man conducts himself according
to his natural impulses. In this way he conducts himself
in conformity with his desires and inclinations, while the
rational, on the contrary, is the obtaining supremacy over
the immediately natural. “In the condition of nature a
certain irresistible power grants the right to rule over those
who cannot resist; it is absurd to leave those whom we
have in our power to become free and strong again.”
From this Hobbes draws the conclusion that “man must
go forth from the natural condition.”<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> This is true; the
natural condition is not what it should be, and must hence
be cast off.</p>

<p>c. Hobbes finally passes to the laws of reason which
preserve tranquillity. This condition of law is the subjection
of the natural, particular will of the individual to the
universal will, which, however, is not that of all individuals,
but is the will of the ruler; this is consequently not responsible
to individuals, but is directed against this private will,
and to it all must be obedient.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Thus the whole matter is
now placed on quite another footing. But because the
universal will is made to reside in the will of one monarch,
there nevertheless proceeds from this point of view, which
is really correct, a condition of absolute rule, of perfect
despotism. The condition of law does not, however, mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
that the arbitrary will of one man constitutes absolute
law, for the universal will is no despotism, being rational,
inasmuch as it is consistently expressed and determined in
laws.</p>

<p>Rixner (Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie,
Vol. III. p. 30) says: “Law to him is nothing but the sum
of the conditions of peace extorted by iron necessity from
the original wickedness of mankind.” We might add that
in Hobbes we at least find this, that the nature and
organism of the State is established on the principle of
human nature, human desire, &amp;c. The English concerned
themselves greatly with that principle of passive obedience,
in accordance with which it is said that kings receive their
power from God. This, in one aspect, is quite true, but in
another it is falsely taken to mean that they have no
responsibility, that their blind desires, their merely subjective
will, is what must be obeyed.</p>

<h3><a id="c319">4. <span class="smcap">Cudworth, Clarke, Wollaston.</span></a></h3>

<p>Cudworth wished to revive Plato in England, but to do
this after the manner of the demonstrations which we met
with in Descartes, and through a trivial metaphysic of the
understanding. He wrote a celebrated work: “The true
intellectual System of the Universe,” but the Platonic ideas
expressed are often in a clumsy form and mingled with the
Christian conceptions of God and angels—all regarded as
particular existent things. What in Plato is mythical, is
here taken as reality in the form of existence; this is
reasoned about just as we reason respecting a matter of
ordinary fact, such as whether it is probable that the French
seek to effect a landing in England, and if so, whether they
will successfully accomplish it. The Christian intellectual
world is dragged down to the form of ordinary actuality,
and consequently it is ruined.</p>

<p>The name of Clarke is likewise famous in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
with his proof of the existence of God. There were quite
a number of other English philosophers, whom we do not,
however, require to notice; for Clarke, Wollaston, and
others carry on their speculations within forms such as
belong to a very commonplace metaphysic of the understanding.
The manifold systems of moral philosophy
which we find taking their rise in England are drawn up
from this same mental standpoint; in them the implicitude
of mind appears in a form of natural existence, namely, of
desires and feelings. Their principles are found in moral
sentiments, benevolent desires, sympathy, &amp;c. That form
alone is worthy of notice which, on the one hand, represents
duty as something which is not foreign, given, commanded,
but as clearly belonging to self-consciousness, even while, on
the other hand, it represents this property as a natural, unconscious,
unspiritual, and irrational existence. Impulse is
blind, a solid existence which cannot get beyond itself like
thinking self-consciousness. It is indeed true of impulse
that its pure activity or its process, and the content, are, as
in thought, immediately posited as the same; it has its content
in itself, and this is not dead and passive, but self-acting
and impelling. But that unity has the form of
immediacy only as existent; in the first place it is not a
knowledge, it is not necessary, for it is only taken from
inward perception; in the second place, it is a determinate
which does not abrogate itself, beyond which we cannot
get, and which thus is not a universal. Impulse is no more
an infinite than is the fixed category of force. Such reasoning
takes the impulses in their determinate character from
experience, and expresses the appearance of necessity in
the same as an inward existence, as a force. For instance,
the social instinct is a moment which is found in experience,
because man derives all manner of utility from society.
Wherein does the necessity of the State, of society, find its
basis? In a social desire. This is cause, just as in the
physical world a formal interpretation such as this is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to be found. The necessity of any existent fact, such as
what pertains to electrical phenomena, finds its basis in a
force which brings it forth; it is merely the form of returning
from the external to an inward, of passing from the
existent to what is thought, which is again in turn represented
as an existent. Force is necessitated by reason of
the manifestation, we must argue from the latter to the
former. On the other hand, the manifestation takes place
through the force, for it is the cause of the manifestation;
we hence have force in one place as reason, and in another
as cause. But in all this there is no realization of the fact
that in respect of form there is a transition from the Notion
into Being and the other way, while in respect of content
there is a perfect contingency of manifestation; we look
at electricity in the same way as we look at the fact that
men have social instincts, sympathetic inclinations, and
so on.</p>

<h3><a id="c321">5. <span class="smcap">Puffendorf.</span></a></h3>

<p>In the struggle to give to just and equitable relations
in the State an independent basis of their own, and to
found a judicial system of government, reflective thought
put forth its efforts; and this became to it a real
interest and concern. And, as in the case of Grotius,
it was also true of Puffendorf, that the instinct of
mankind—that is, the social instinct, &amp;c.—was made the
principle. Samuel von Puffendorf was born in 1632 in
Saxony; he studied public law, philosophy, and mathematics
at Leipzig and Jena; in 1661, as a professor at
Heidelberg, he made natural and civil law for the first
time academic studies; in 1668 he became tutor in a
Swedish family, which office he later on exchanged for the
service of the House of Brandenburg, and in 1694 he died
at Berlin as a privy councillor. He wrote several works
on political law and history; we must specially mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
his work, <i>De jure naturæ et gentium</i>, Libr. viii., Londin.
Scan. 1672, 4; and also his compendium <i>De officio hominis</i>,
published at the same place in 1673, 8, and <i>Elementa
jurisprudentiæ universalis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> While the divine right of
kings was here still recognized—whereby they rendered
account to God alone, or, at all events, were still bound to
take counsel of the Church—the impulses and necessities
present in mankind were now considered as well. These
were regarded as the inward principles for private and
political law, and from them the duties both of the government
and of rulers were deduced, so that the freedom of
mankind might not be interfered with. The basis of the
state in Puffendorf’s view is the social instinct: the highest
end of the state is the peace and security of social life
through the transformation of inward duties as prescribed
by conscience into external duties as compelled by law.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c322">6. <span class="smcap">Newton.</span></a></h3>

<p>The other side is that thought likewise applied itself to
nature, and in this connection Isaac Newton is famous by
reason of his mathematical discoveries and his work in
physics. He was born in 1642 at Cambridge, made a
special study of mathematics, and became professor of the
same at Cambridge; later on he was made president of
the Royal Society in London, and he died in 1727.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>Newton was indisputably the chief contributor to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
popularity of the philosophy of Locke, or the English
method of treating of Philosophy, and more especially did
he promote its application to all the physical sciences.
“Physics, beware of metaphysics,” was his maxim,<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> which
signifies, Science, beware of thought; and all the physical
sciences, even to the present day, have, following in his
wake, faithfully observed this precept, inasmuch as they
have not entered upon an investigation of their conceptions,
or thought about thoughts. Physics can, however, effect
nothing without thought; it has its categories and laws
through thought alone, and without thought it does not
effect any progress. Newton was mainly instrumental in
introducing to physics the determinations respecting forces,
which pertain to reflection; he raised science to the standpoint
of reflection, and set the laws of forces in the place
of the laws of phenomena. Regarding matters as he did,
Newton derived his conclusions from his experiences; and
in physics and the theory of colour-vision, he made bad
observations and drew worse conclusions. He passed from
experiences to general points of view, again made them
fundamental, and from them constructed the individual;
this is how his theories are constructed. The observation
of things, the discovery of the law immanent therein, and
the universal which is found within them, has become
the real point of interest. In this way, Newton is so
complete a barbarian as regards his conceptions that his
case is like that of another of his countrymen who was
surprised and rejoiced to learn that he had talked prose all
his life, not having had any idea that he was so accomplished.
This Newton, like all the Physicists, indeed, never
learned; he did not know that he thought in, and had to
deal with Notions, while he imagined he was dealing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
physical facts: and he presented the extremest contrast to
Boehme, who handled sensuous things as Notions, and, by
sheer force of mind, obtained entire possession of their
actuality and subjugated them. Instead of this Newton
treated Notions like sensuous things, and dealt with them
just as men deal with wood and stone. And this is even
now the case. In the beginnings of physical science we
read of the power of inertia, for instance, of the force of
acceleration, of molecules, of centripetal and centrifugal
force, as of facts which definitely exist; what are really
the final results of reflection are represented as their first
grounds. If we ask for the cause of there being no
advance made in such sciences, we find that it is because
men do not understand that they should apply themselves
to Notions, but make up their minds to adopt these
determinations without sense or understanding. Hence
in Newton’s Optics, for instance, there are conclusions
derived from his experience which are so untrue and devoid
of understanding, that while they are set forth as the
finest example of how men can learn to know nature by
means of experiments and conclusions derived from experiments,
they may also serve as an example of how we
should neither experiment nor draw conclusions, of how
nothing at all can be learned. A miserable kind of experience
like this itself contradicts itself through nature, for
nature is more excellent than it appears in this wretched
experience: both nature itself and experience, when carried
a little further, contradict it. Hence, of all the splendid
discoveries of Newton in optics, none now remain excepting
one—the division of light into seven colours. This is
partly because the conception of whole and part come into
play, and partly from an obdurate closing of the eyes to
the opposite side. From this empirical method in Philosophy,
we shall now pass on to Leibnitz.</p>

<p>The third development of the philosophy of the understanding
is that represented by Leibnitz and Wolff. If
Wolff’s metaphysics is divested of its rigid form, we have
as a result the later popular philosophy.</p>

<h3><a id="c325b">1. <span class="smcap">Leibnitz.</span></a></h3>

<p>As in other respects Leibnitz represents the extreme antithesis
to Newton, so in respect of philosophy he presents
a striking contrast to Locke and his empiricism, and also
to Spinoza. He upholds thought as against the perception
of the English school, and in lieu of sensuous
Being he maintains Being for thought to be the essence of
truth, just as Boehme at an earlier time upheld implicit
Being. While Spinoza asserted the universality, the oneness
of substance merely, and while with Locke we saw
infinite determinations made the basis, Leibnitz, by means
of his fundamental principle of individuality, brings out the
essentiality of the opposite aspect of Spinoza’s philosophy,
existence for self, the monad, but the monad regarded as
the absolute Notion, though perhaps not yet as the “I.”
The opposed principles, which were forced asunder, find
their completion in each other, since Leibnitz’s principle of
individuation completed Spinoza’s system as far as outward
aspect goes.</p>

<p>Gottfried Wilhelm, Baron von Leibnitz, was born in 1646
at Leipzig, where his father was professor of Philosophy.
The subject that he studied in view of a profession was
jurisprudence, but first, in accordance with the fashion of
the day, he made a study of Philosophy, and to it he
devoted particular attention. To begin with, he picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
up in Leipzig a large and miscellaneous stock of knowledge,
then he studied Philosophy and mathematics at
Jena under the mathematician and theosophist Weigel,
and took his degree of Master of Philosophy in Leipzig.
There also, on the occasion of his graduation as Doctor of
Philosophy, he defended certain philosophical theses, some
of which discourses are still contained in his works (ed.
Dutens, T. II. P. I. p. 400). His first dissertation, and
that for which he obtained the degree of doctor of
philosophy, was: <i>De principio individui</i>,—a principle
which remained the abstract principle of his whole
philosophy, as opposed to that of Spinoza. After he had
acquired a thorough knowledge of the subject, he wished
to graduate also as Doctor of Laws. But though he
died an imperial councillor, it was his ill fortune to receive
from the Faculty at Leipzig a refusal to confer the
doctorate upon him, his youth being the alleged reason.
Such a thing could scarcely happen now-a-days. It may be
that it was done because of his over-great philosophical
attainments, seeing that lawyers are wont to hold the same
in horror. He now quitted Leipzig, and betook himself to
Altdorf, where he graduated with distinction. Shortly
afterwards he became acquainted in Nürnberg with a
company of alchemists, with whose ongoings he became
associated. Here he made extracts from alchemistic
writings, and studied the mysteries of this occult science.
His activity in the pursuit of learning extended also to
historical, diplomatic, mathematical and philosophical
subjects. He subsequently entered the service of the
Elector of Mayence, becoming a member of council, and
in 1672 he was appointed tutor to a son of Von Boineburg,
Chancellor of State to the Elector. With this young man
he travelled to Paris, where he lived for four years. He at
this time made the acquaintance of the great mathematician
Huygens, and was by him for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
properly introduced into the domain of mathematics.
When the education of his pupil was completed, and the
Baron Von Boineburg died, Leibnitz went on his own
account to London, where he became acquainted with
Newton and other scholars, at whose head was Oldenburg,
who was also on friendly terms with Spinoza. After the
death of the Elector of Mayence, the salary of Leibnitz
ceased to be paid; he therefore left England and returned
to France. The Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg then took
him into his service, and gave him the appointment of
councillor and librarian at Hanover, with permission to
spend as much time as he liked in foreign countries. He
therefore remained for some time longer in France,
England, and Holland. In the year 1677 he settled down
in Hanover, where he became busily engaged in affairs of
state, and was specially occupied with historical matters.
In the Harz Mountains he had works constructed for
carrying off the floods which did damage to the mines
there. Notwithstanding these manifold occupations he
invented the differential calculus in 1677, on occasion of
which there arose a dispute between him and Newton, which
was carried on by the latter and the Royal Society of
London in a most ungenerous manner. For it was asserted
by the English, who gave themselves the credit of
everything, and were very unfair to others, that the discovery
was really made by Newton. But Newton’s <i>Principia</i>
only appeared later, and in the first edition indeed
Leibnitz was mentioned with commendation in a note which
was afterwards omitted. From his headquarters in Hanover,
Leibnitz, commissioned by his prince, made several
journeys through Germany, and also went to Italy in order
to collect historical evidence relative to the House of Este,
and for the purpose of proving more clearly the relationship
between this princely family and that of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
At other times he was likewise much occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
with historical questions. Owing to his acquaintance with
the consort of Frederick I. of Prussia, Sophia Charlotte, a
Hanoverian princess, he was enabled to bring about the
foundation of an Academy of Science in Berlin, in which
city he lived for a considerable time. In Vienna he also
became acquainted with Prince Eugène, which occasioned
his being appointed finally an Imperial Councillor. He
published several very important historical works as the
result of this journey. His death took place at Hanover in
1716, when he was seventy years of age.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>It was not only on Philosophy, but also on the most
varied branches of science that Leibnitz expended toil and
trouble and energy; it was to mathematics, however, that he
specially devoted his attention, and he is the inventor of
the methods of the integral and differential calculus. His
great services in regard to mathematics and physics we
here leave out of consideration, and pay attention to his
philosophy alone. None of his books can be exactly
looked on as giving a complete systematic account of his
philosophy. To the more important among them belongs
his work on the human understanding (<i>Nouveaux essais sur
l’entendement humain</i>) in reply to Locke; but this is a
mere refutation. His philosophy is therefore scattered
through various little treatises which were written in very
various connections, in letters, and replies to objections
which caused him to bring out one aspect of the question
more strongly than another; we consequently find no
elaborated systematic whole, superintended or perfected
by him. The work which has some appearance of being
such, his <i>Théodicée</i>, better known to the public than anything
else he wrote, is a popular treatise which he drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
up for Queen Sophia Charlotte in reply to Bayle, and in
which he took pains not to present the matter in very
speculative form. A Wurtemberg theologian, Pfaff by
name, and others who were correspondents of Leibnitz
and were themselves only too well versed in philosophy,
brought it as a charge against Leibnitz—a charge which
he never denied—that his philosophy was written in
popular form.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> They laughed very much afterwards at
Wolff, who had taken them to be quite in earnest; his
opinion was that if Leibnitz were not perfectly serious in this
sense with his <i>Théodicée</i>, yet he had unconsciously written
his best therein. Leibnitz’s <i>Théodicée</i> is not what we can
altogether appreciate; it is a justification of God in regard
to the evil in the world. His really philosophic thoughts
are most connectedly expressed in a treatise on the
principles of Grace (<i>Principes de la Nature et de la Grace</i>),<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
and especially in the pamphlet addressed to Prince Eugène
of Savoy.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Buhle (Geschichte der neuern Philosophie,
vol. iv. section 1, p. 131) says: “His philosophy is not so
much the product of free, independent, original speculation,
as the result of well-tested earlier” and later
“systems, an eclecticism whose defects he tried to remedy
in his own way. It is a desultory treatment of Philosophy
in letters.”</p>

<p>Leibnitz followed the same general plan in his philosophy
as the physicists adopt when they advance a hypothesis
to explain existing data. He has it that general
conceptions of the Idea are to be found, from which the
particular may be derived; here, on account of existing
data, the general conception, for example the determination
of force or matter furnished by reflection, must have
its determinations disposed in such a way that it fits in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
with the data. Thus the philosophy of Leibnitz seems to
be not so much a philosophic system as an hypothesis
regarding the existence of the world, namely how it is to
be determined in accordance with the metaphysical determinations
and the data and assumptions of the ordinary
conception, which are accepted as valid<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>—thoughts which
are moreover propounded without the sequence pertaining
to the Notion and mainly in narrative style, and which taken
by themselves show no necessity in their connection.
Leibnitz’s philosophy therefore appears like a string of
arbitrary assertions, which follow one on another like a
metaphysical romance; it is only when we see what he
wished thereby to avoid that we learn to appreciate its
value. He really makes use of external reasons mainly
in order to establish relations: “Because the validity
of such relations cannot be allowed, nothing remains
but to establish the matter in this way.” If we are not
acquainted with these reasons, this procedure strikes us as
arbitrary.</p>

<p>a. Leibnitz’s philosophy is an idealism of the intellectuality
of the universe; and although from one point
of view he stands opposed to Locke, as from another point
of view he is in opposition to the Substance of Spinoza, he
yet binds them both together again. For, to go into the
matter more particularly, on the one hand he expresses in
the many monads the absolute nature of things distinguished
and of individuality; on the other hand, in
contrast to this and apart from it, he expresses the ideality
of Spinoza and the non-absolute nature of all difference, as
the idealism of the popular conception. Leibnitz’s philosophy
is a metaphysics, and in sharp contrast to the
simple universal Substance of Spinoza, where all that is
determined is merely transitory, it makes fundamental the
absolute multiplicity of individual substances, which after
the example of the ancients he named monads—an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
already used by the Pythagoreans. These monads he
then proceeds to determine as follows.</p>

<p>Firstly “Substance is a thing that is capable of
activity, it is compound or simple, the compound cannot
exist without the simple. The monads are simple substances.”
The proof that they constitute the truth in all
things is very simple, it is a superficial reflection. For
instance, one of Leibnitz’s maxims is “Because there are
compound things, the principles of the same must be
simple, for the compound consists of the simple.”<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> This
proof is poor enough, it is an example of the favourite
way of starting from something definite, say the compound,
and then drawing conclusions therefrom as to the simple.
It is quite light in a way, but really it is tautology. Of
course, if the compound exists, so does the simple, for the
compound means something in itself manifold whose connection
or unity is external. From the very trivial category
of the compound it is easy to deduce the simple. It is a
conclusion drawn from a certain premiss, but the question
is whether the premiss is true. These monads are not,
however, something abstract and simple in itself, like the
empty Epicurean atoms, which, as they were in themselves
lacking in determination, drew all their determination from
their aggregation alone. The monads are, on the contrary,
substantial forms, a good expression, borrowed from the
Scholastics (<i>supra</i>, p. 71), or the metaphysical points of
the Alexandrian School (Vol II. p. 439), they are the
entelechies of Aristotle taken as pure activity, which are
forms in themselves (Vol II. pp. 138, 182, 183). “These
monads are not material or extended, nor do they originate
or decay in the natural fashion, for they can begin only by
a creative act of God, and they can end only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
annihilation.”<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Thereby they are distinguished from the atoms,
which are regarded simply as principles. The expression
creation we are familiar with from religion, but it is a
meaningless word derived from the ordinary conception;
in order to be a thought and to have philosophic significance,
it must be much more closely defined.</p>

<p>Secondly: “On account of their simplicity the monads
are not susceptible of alteration by another monad in their
inner essence; there is no causal connection between them.”
Each of them is something indifferent and independent as
regards the rest, otherwise it would not be an entelechy.
Each of them is so much for itself that all its determinations
and modifications go on in itself alone, and no determination
from without takes place. Leibnitz says: “There
are three ways in which substances are connected: (1)
Causality, influence; (2) The relation of assistance; (3)
The relation of harmony. The relation of influence is a
relation pertaining to a commonplace or popular philosophy.
But as it is impossible to understand how material particles
or immaterial qualities can pass from one substance into
another, such a conception as this must be abandoned.”
If we accept the reality of the many, there can be no
transition at all; each is an ultimate and absolutely independent
entity. “The system of assistance,” according
to Descartes, “is something quite superfluous, a <i>Deus ex
machina</i>, because continual miracles in the things of nature
are assumed.” If we, like Descartes, assume independent
substances, no causal nexus is conceivable; for this presupposes
an influence, a bearing of the one upon the other,
and in this way the other is not a substance. “Therefore
there remains only harmony, a unity which is in itself or
implicit. The monad is therefore simply shut up in itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and cannot be determined by another; this other cannot
be set into it. It can neither get outside itself, nor can
others get inside it.”<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> That is also Spinoza’s way of
regarding matters: each attribute entirely represents the
essence of God for itself, extension and thought have no
influence on each other.</p>

<p>In the third place, “however, these monads must at the
same time have certain qualities or determinations in themselves,
inner actions, through which they are distinguished
from others. There cannot be two things alike, for otherwise
they would not be two, they would not be different,
but one and the same.”<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Here then Leibnitz’s axiom of
the undistinguishable comes into words. What is not in
itself distinguished is not distinguished. This may be
taken in a trivial sense, as that there are not two individuals
which are alike. To such sensuous things the
maxim has no application, it is <i>prima facie</i> indifferent
whether there are things which are alike or not; there
may also be always a difference of space. This is the
superficial sense, which does not concern us. The more
intimate sense is, however, that each thing is in itself
something determined, distinguishing itself from others
implicitly or in itself. Whether two things are like or
unlike is only a comparison which we make, which falls
within our ken. But what we have further to consider is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the determined difference in themselves. The difference
must be a difference in themselves, not for our comparison,
for the subject must have the difference as its own peculiar
characteristic or determination, <i>i.e.</i> the determination
must be immanent in the individual. Not only do we
distinguish the animal by its claws, but it distinguishes
itself essentially thereby, it defends itself, it preserves
itself. If two things are different only in being two, then
each of them is one; but the fact of their being two does
not constitute a distinction between them; the determined
difference in itself is the principal point.</p>

<p>Fourthly: “The determinateness and the variation thereby
established is, however, an inward implicit principle; it
is a multiplicity of modifications, of relations to surrounding
existences, but a multiplicity which remains locked up in
simplicity. Determinateness and variation such as this,
which remains and goes on in the existence itself, is a
perception;” and therefore Leibnitz says all monads perceive
or represent (for we may translate <i>perceptio</i> by representation
[Vorstellung]). In other words, they are in themselves
universal, for universality is just simplicity in multiplicity,
and therefore a simplicity which is at the same time
change and motion of multiplicity. This is a very important
determination; in substance itself there is negativity,
determinateness, without its simplicity and its implicitude
being given up. Further, in it there is this idealism, that
the simple is something in itself distinguished, and in spite
of its variation, that it yet remains one, and continues in its
simplicity. An instance of this is found in “I,” my spirit.
I have many conceptions, a wealth of thought is in me, and
yet I remain one, notwithstanding this variety of state.
This identity may be found in the fact that what is different
is at the same time abrogated, and is determined as one;
the monads are therefore distinguished by modifications in
themselves, but not by external determinations. These
determinations contained in the monads exist in them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
ideal fashion; this ideality in the monad is in itself a whole,
so that these differences are only representations and ideas.
This absolute difference is what is termed the Notion; what
falls asunder in the mere representation is held together.
This is what possesses interest in Leibnitz’s philosophy.
Such ideality in the same way pertains to the material,
which is also a multiplicity of monads; therefore the system
of Leibnitz is an intellectual system, in accordance
with which all that is material has powers of representation
and perception. As thus representing, the monad, says
Leibnitz, possesses activity; for activity is to be different,
and yet to be one, and this is the only true difference. The
monad not only represents, it also changes; but in doing
so, it yet remains in itself absolutely what it is. This
variation is based on activity. “The activity of the inner
principle, by means of which it passes from one perception
to another, is desire (<i>appetitus</i>).” Variation in representation
is desire, and that constitutes the spontaneity of
the monad; all is now complete in itself, and the category
of influence falls away. Indeed, this intellectuality of
all things is a great thought on the part of Leibnitz: “All
multiplicity is included in unity;”<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> determination is not a
difference in respect of something else, but reflected into
itself, and maintaining itself. This is one aspect of things,
but the matter is not therein complete; it is equally the
case that it is different in respect of other things.</p>

<p>Fifthly: These representations and ideas are not necessarily
conscious representations and ideas, any more than all
monads as forming representations are conscious. It is
true that consciousness is itself perception, but a higher
grade of the same; perceptions of consciousness Leibnitz
calls apperceptions. The difference between the merely
representing and the self-conscious monads Leibnitz makes
one of degrees of clearness. The expression representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
has, however, certainly something awkward about it, since
we are accustomed to associate it only with consciousness,
and with consciousness as such; but Leibnitz admits also
of unconscious representation. When he then adduces
examples of unconscious representations, he appeals to the
condition of a swoon or of sleep, in which we are mere
monads: and that representations without consciousness
are present in such states he shows from the fact of our
having perceptions immediately after awakening out of
sleep, which shows that others must have been there, for
one perception arises only out of others.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> That is a trivial
and empirical demonstration.</p>

<p>Sixthly: These monads constitute the principle of all
that exists. Matter is nothing else than their passive capability.
This passive capability it is which constitutes the
obscurity of the representations, or a confusion which never
arrives at distinction, or desire, or activity.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> That is a
correct definition of the conception; it is Being, matter, in
accordance with the moment of simplicity. This is implicitly
activity; “mere implicitness without actualization” would
therefore be a better expression. The transition from obscurity
to distinctness Leibnitz exemplifies by the state of
swooning.</p>

<p>Seventhly: Bodies as bodies are aggregates of monads:
they are mere heaps which cannot be termed substances,
any more than a flock of sheep can bear this name.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The
continuity of the same is an arrangement or extension, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
space is nothing in itself;<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> it is only in another, or a unity
which our understanding gives to that aggregate.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>b. Leibnitz goes on to determine and distinguish more
clearly as the principal moments, inorganic, organic, and
conscious monads, and he does it in the following way.</p>

<p>α. Such bodies as have no inner unity, whose elements
are connected merely by space, or externally, are inorganic;
they have not an entelechy or one monad which rules over
the rest.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The continuity of space as a merely external
relation has not the Notion in itself of the likeness of these
monads in themselves. Continuity is in fact to be regarded
in them as an arrangement, a similarity in themselves.
Leibnitz therefore defines their movements as like one
another, as a harmony in themselves;<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> but again, this is as
much as saying that their similarity is not in themselves.
In fact continuity forms the essential determination of the
inorganic; but it must at the same time not be taken as
something external or as likeness, but as penetrating or
penetrated unity, which has dissolved individuality in
itself like a fluid. But to this point Leibnitz does not
attain, because for him monads are the absolute principle,
and individuality does not annul itself.</p>

<p>β. A higher degree of Being is found in bodies with life
and soul, in which one monad has dominion over the rest.
The body which is bound up with the monad, of which
the one monad is the entelechy or soul, is with this soul
named a living creature, an animal. One such entelechy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
rules over the rest, yet not really, but formally: the limbs
of this animal, however, are again themselves such living
things, each of which has in its turn its ruling entelechy
within it.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But ruling is here an inappropriate expression.
To rule in this case is not to rule over others, for all are
independent; it is therefore only a formal expression. If
Leibnitz had not helped himself out with the word rule,
and developed the idea further, this dominant monad would
have abrogated the others, and put them in a negative
position; the implicitness of the other monads, or the
principle of the absolute Being of these points or individuals
would have disappeared. Yet we shall later on come
across this relation of the individuals to one another.</p>

<p>γ. The conscious monad distinguishes itself from the
naked (material) monads by the distinctness of the representation.
But this is of course only an indefinite word,
a formal distinction; it indicates that consciousness is the
very thing that constitutes the distinction of the undistinguished,
and that distinction constitutes the determination
of consciousness. Leibnitz more particularly
defined the distinction of man as that “he is capable of the
knowledge of necessary and eternal truths,”—or that he
conceives the universal on the one hand, and on the other
what is connected with it; the nature and essence of self-consciousness
lies in the universality of the Notions.
“These eternal truths rest on two maxims; the one is
that of contradiction, the other is that of sufficient reason.”
The former of these is unity expressed in useless fashion as
a maxim, the distinction of the undistinguishable, A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A;
it is the definition of thinking, but not a maxim which
could contain a truth as content, or it does not express the
Notion of distinction as such. The other important
principle was, on the other hand: What is not distinguished
in thought is not distinguished (p. 333). “The maxim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the reason is that everything has its reason,”<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>—the particular
has the universal as its essential reality. Necessary
truth must have its reason in itself in such a manner that
it is found by analysis, <i>i.e.</i> through that very maxim of
identity. For analysis is the very favourite plan of
resolving into simple ideas and principles: a resolution
which annihilates their relation, and which therefore in
fact forms a transition into the opposite, though it does
not have the consciousness of the same, and on that account
also excludes the Notion; for every opposite it lays hold
of only in its identity. Sufficient reason seems to be a
pleonasm; but Leibnitz understood by this aims, final
causes (<i>causæ finales</i>), the difference between which and the
causal nexus or the efficient cause he here brings under
discussion.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>c. The universal itself, absolute essence, which with
Leibnitz is something quite different from the monads,
separates itself also into two sides, namely universal Being
and Being as the unity of opposites.</p>

<p>α. That universal is God, as the cause of the world, to
the consciousness of whom the above principle of sufficient
reason certainly forms the transition. The existence of
God is only an inference from eternal truths; for these
must as the laws of nature have a universal sufficient
reason which determines itself as none other than God.
Eternal truth is therefore the consciousness of the
universal and absolute in and for itself; and this universal
and absolute is God, who, as one with Himself,
the monad of monads, is the absolute <i>Monas</i>. Here we
again have the wearisome proof of His existence: He is
the fountain of eternal truths and Notions, and without
Him no potentiality would have actuality; He has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
prerogative of existing immediately in His potentiality.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
God is here also the unity of potentiality and actuality, but
in an uncomprehending manner; what is necessary, but not
comprehended, is transferred to Him. Thus God is at first
comprehended chiefly as universal, but already in the
aspect of the relation of opposites.</p>

<p>β. As regards this second aspect, the absolute relation of
opposites, it occurs in the first place in the form of
absolute opposites of thought, the good and the evil. “God
is the Author of the world,” says Leibnitz; that refers
directly to evil. It is round this relation that philosophy
specially revolves, but to the unity of which it did not
then attain; the evil in the world was not comprehended,
because no advance was made beyond the fixed opposition.
The result of Leibnitz’s Théodicée is an optimism supported
on the lame and wearisome thought that God, since a world
had to be brought into existence, chose out of infinitely
many possible worlds the best possible—the most perfect,
so far as it could be perfect, considering the finite element
which it was to contain.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> This may very well be said in a
general way, but this perfection is no determined thought, but
a loose popular expression, a sort of babble respecting an
imaginary or fanciful potentiality; Voltaire made merry over
it. Nor is the nature of the finite therein defined. Because
the world, it is said, has to be the epitome of finite Beings,
evil could not be separated from it, since evil is negation,
finitude.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Reality and negation remain standing in opposition
to one another exactly in the same way as before.
That is the principal conception in the Théodicée. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
something very like this can be said in every-day life. If
I have some goods brought to me in the market at some
town, and say that they are certainly not perfect, but the
best that are to be got, this is quite a good reason why I
should content myself with them. But comprehension is a
very different thing from this. Leibnitz says nothing
further than that the world is good, but there is also evil
in it; the matter remains just the same as it was before.
“Because it had to be finite” is then a mere arbitrary
choice on the part of God. The next question would be:
Why and how is there finitude in the Absolute and His
decrees? And only then should there be deduced from the
determination of finitude the evil which no doubt exists
therein.</p>

<p>It is true that Leibnitz has a reply to the above question:
“God does not will what is evil; evil comes only indirectly
into the results” (blind), “because oftentimes the greater
good could not be achieved if evils were not present.
Therefore they are means to a good end.” But why does
not God employ other means? They are always external,
not in and for themselves. “A moral evil may not be
regarded as a means, nor must we, as the apostle says, do
evil that good may come; yet it has often the relation of a
<i>conditio sine qua non</i> of the good. Evil is in God only the
object of a permissive will (<i>voluntatis permissivæ</i>);” but
everything that is wrong would be such. “God has therefore
among the objects of His will the best possible as the
ultimate object, but the good as a matter of choice (<i>qualemcunque</i>),
also as subordinate; and things indifferent and
evils often as means. Evil is, however, an object of His
will only as the condition of something otherwise necessary
(<i>rei alioqui debitæ</i>), which without it could not exist;
in which sense Christ said it must needs be that offences
come.”<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>In a general sense we are satisfied with the answer:
“In accordance with the wisdom of God we must accept it
as a fact that the laws of nature are the best possible,” but
this answer does not suffice for a definite question. What
one wishes to know is the goodness of this or that particular
law; and to that no answer is given. If, for
example, it is said that “The law of falling bodies, in which
the relation of time and space is the square, is the best
possible,” one might employ, as far as mathematics are
concerned, any other power whatever. When Leibnitz
answers: “God made it so,” this is no answer at all.
We wish to know the definite reason of this law; such
general determinations sound pious, but are not satisfying.</p>

<p>γ. He goes on to say that the sufficient reason has
reference to the representation of the monads. The principles
of things are monads, of which each is for itself,
without having influence on the others. If now the Monad
of monads, God, is the absolute substance, and individual
monads are created through His will, their substantiality
comes to an end. There is therefore a contradiction
present, which remains unsolved in itself—that is between
the one substantial monad and the many monads for
which independence is claimed, because their essence consists
in their standing in no relation to one another.
Yet at the same time, in order to show the harmony that
exists in the world, Leibnitz understands the relation of
monads to monads more generally as the unity of contrasted
existences, namely of soul and body. This unity
he represents as a relation without difference, and notionless,
<i>i.e.</i> as a pre-established harmony.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Leibnitz uses here
the illustration of two clocks, which are set to the same
hour, and keep the same time;<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> in the same way the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
movement of the kingdom of thought goes on, determined
in accordance with ends, and the movement onward of
the corporeal kingdom which corresponds with it, proceeds
according to a general causal connection.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The case is the
same as with Spinoza, that these two sides of the universe
have no connection with each other, the one does not
influence the other, but both are entirely indifferent to
one another; it is really the differentiating relation of the
Notion that is lacking. In abstract thought that is without
Notion, that determination now receives the form of
simplicity, of implicitude, of indifference with regard to
what is other, of a self-reflection that has no movement:
in this way red in the abstract is in a position of indifference
as regards blue, &amp;c. Here, as before, Leibnitz
forsakes his principle of individuation; it has only the
sense of being exclusively one, and of not reaching to
and including what is other; or it is only a unity of the
popular conception, not the Notion of unity. The soul
has thus a series of conceptions and ideas which are
developed from within it, and this series is from the very
first placed within the soul at its creation, <i>i.e.</i> the soul is in
all immediacy this implicit determination; determination is,
however, not implicit, but the reflected unfolding of this
determination in the ordinary conception is its outward
existence. Parallel with this series of differentiated conceptions,
there now runs a series of motions of the body,
or of what is external to the soul.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Both are essential
moments of reality; they are mutually indifferent, but
they have also an essential relation of difference.</p>

<p>Since now every monad, as shut up within itself, has no
influence upon the body and its movements, and yet the infinite
multitude of their atoms correspond with one another,
Leibnitz places this harmony in God; a better definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
of the relation and the activity of the Monad of monads is
therefore that it is what pre-establishes harmony in the
changes of the monads.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> God is the sufficient reason, the
cause of this correspondence; He has so arranged the
multitude of atoms that the original changes which are
developed within one monad correspond with the changes
of the others. The pre-established harmony is to be
thought of somewhat in this style; when a dog gets a
beating, the pain develops itself in him, in like fashion the
beating develops itself in itself, and so does the person
who administers the beating: their determinations all
correspond with one another, and that not by means of
their objective connection, since each is independent.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The
principle of the harmony among the monads does not
consequently belong to them, but it is in God, who for
that very reason is the Monad of monads, their absolute
unity. We saw from the beginning how Leibnitz arrived
at this conception. Each monad is really possessed of the
power of representation, and is as such a representation of
the universe, therefore implicitly the totality of the whole
world. But at the same time this representation is not in
consciousness; the naked monad is implicitly the universe,
and difference is the development of this totality in it.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
What develops itself therein is at the same time in harmony
with all other developments; all is one harmony. “In
the universe all things are closely knit together, they are
in one piece, like an ocean: the slightest movement transmits
its influence far and wide all around.”<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> From a
single grain of sand, Leibnitz holds, the whole universe
might be comprehended in its entire development—if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
only knew the sand grain thoroughly. There is not really
much in all this, though it sounds very fine; for the
rest of the universe is considerably more than a grain of
sand, well though we knew it, and considerably different
therefrom. To say that its essence is the universe is mere
empty talk: for the fact is that the universe as essence is
not the universe. To the sand grain much must be added
which is not present; and since thought adds more than all
the grains of sand that exist, the universe and its development
may in this way certainly be comprehended. Thus
according to Leibnitz every monad has or is the representation
of the entire universe, which is the same as
saying that it is really representation in general; but at the
same time it is a determinate representation, by means of
which it comes to be this particular monad, therefore it is
representation according to its particular situation and
circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The representations of the monad in itself, which constitute
its universe, develop themselves from themselves, as the
spiritual element in it, according to the laws of their own activity
and desire, just as the movements of their outer world
do according to laws of bodies; hence liberty is nothing
other than this spontaneity of immanent development, but
as in consciousness. The magnetic needle, on the contrary,
has only spontaneity without consciousness, and consequently
without freedom. For, says Leibnitz, the nature of the
magnetic needle is to turn to the north; if it had consciousness
it would imagine that this was its self-determination;
it would thus have the will to move round in
accordance with its nature.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> But it is clear that in the
course of conscious representations there is involved no
necessary connection, but contingency and want of sequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
are to be found, the reason of this according to Leibnitz
(Oper. T. II P. I. p. 75) being “because the nature of a
created substance implies that it changes incessantly
according to a certain order, which order guides it spontaneously
(<i>spontanément</i>) in all the circumstances which
befall it; so that one who sees all things recognizes in the
present condition of substance the past also and the future.
The law of order, which determines the individuality of
the particular substance, has an exact reference to what
takes place in every other substance and in the whole
universe.” The meaning of this is that the monad is not a
thing apart, or that there are two views of it, the one making
it out as spontaneously generating its representations, so
far as form is concerned, and the other making it out to be
a moment of the whole of necessity; Spinoza would call
this regarding it from both sides. An organic whole, a
human being, is thus for instance the assertion of his aim
from out of himself: at the same time the being directed
on something else is involved in his Notion. He represents
this and that to himself, he wills this and that;
his activity employs itself and brings about changes. His
inward determination thus becomes corporeal determination,
and then change going beyond himself; he appears
as cause, influencing other monads. But this Being-for-another
is only an appearance. For the other, <i>i.e.</i> the
actual, in so far as the monad determines it or makes it
negative, is the passive element which the monad has in
itself: all moments are indeed contained therein, and for
that very reason it has no need of other monads, but only
of the laws of the monads in itself. But if the Being-for-another
is mere appearance, the same may be said of
Being-for-self; for this has significance only in reference
to Being-for-another.</p>

<p>The important point in Leibnitz’s philosophy is this
intellectuality of representation which Leibnitz, however,
did not succeed in carrying out; and for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
this intellectuality is at the same time infinite multiplicity,
which has remained absolutely independent, because this
intellectuality has not been able to obtain mastery over the
One. The separation in the Notion, which proceeds as far
as release from itself, or appearance in distinct independence,
Leibnitz did not succeed in bringing together into
unity. The harmony of these two moments, the course of
mental representations and the course of things external,
appearing mutually as cause and effect, is not brought
by Leibnitz into relation in and for themselves; he therefore
lets them fall asunder, although each is passive as
regards the other. He moreover considers both of them
in one unity, to be sure, but their activity is at the same
time not for themselves. Every forward advance becomes
therefore incomprehensible when taken by itself, because
the course of the representation as through aims in itself,
requires this moment of Other-Being or of passivity; and
again the connection of cause and effect requires the universal:
each however lacks this its other moment. The
unity which according to Leibnitz is to be brought about
by the pre-established harmony, namely that the determination
of the will of man and the outward change harmonize,
is therefore brought about by means of another, if
not indeed from without, for this other is God. Before
God the monads are not to be independent, but ideal and
absorbed in Him.</p>

<p>At this point the demand would come in that in God
Himself there should be comprehended the required unity
of that which before fell asunder; and God has the special
privilege of having laid on Him the burden of what cannot
be comprehended. The word of God is thus the makeshift
which leads to a unity which itself is only hypothetical;
for the process of the many out of this unity is not demonstrated.
God plays therefore in the later philosophy a far
greater part than in the early, because now the comprehension
of the absolute opposition of thought and Being is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the chief demand. With Leibnitz the extent to which
thoughts advance is the extent of the universe; where
comprehension ceases, the universe ceases, and God begins:
so that later it was even maintained that to be comprehended
was derogatory to God, because He was thus
degraded into finitude. In that procedure a beginning is
made from the determinate, this and that are stated to be
necessary; but since in the next place the unity of these
moments is not comprehended, it is transferred to God.
God is therefore, as it were, the waste channel into which
all contradictions flow: Leibnitz’s Théodicée is just a
popular summing up such as this. There are, nevertheless,
all manner of evasions to be searched out—in the opposition
of God’s justice and mercy, that the one tempers the other;
how the fore-knowledge of God and human freedom are
compatible—all manner of syntheses which never come to
the root of the matter nor show both sides to be moments.</p>

<p>These are the main moments of Leibnitz’s philosophy.
It is a metaphysic which starts from a narrow determination
of the understanding, namely, from absolute multiplicity,
so that connection can only be grasped as continuity.
Thereby absolute unity is certainly set aside, but
all the same it is presupposed; and the association of
individuals with one another is to be explained only in this
way, that it is God who determines the harmony in the
changes of individuals. This is an artificial system, which
is founded on a category of the understanding, that of the
absoluteness of abstract individuality. What is of importance
in Leibnitz lies in the maxims, in the principle of
individuality and the maxim of indistinguishability.</p>

<h3><a id="c348">2. <span class="smcap">Wolff.</span></a></h3>

<p>The philosophy of Wolff is directly connected with that
of Leibnitz, for really it is a pedantic systematization of
the latter, for which reason it is likewise called the
Leibnitz-Wolffian system of philosophy. Wolff attained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
great distinction in mathematics and made himself famous
by his philosophy as well; the latter was for long predominant
in Germany. In Wolff, as a teacher dealing
with the understanding, we find a systematic exposition of
the philosophic element present in human conceptions as
a whole. As regards his connection with German culture
generally, great and immortal praise is more especially due
to him; before all others he may be termed the teacher of
the Germans. We may indeed say that Wolff was the first
to naturalize philosophy in Germany. Tschirnhausen and
Thomasius likewise participated in this honour, for the
special reason that they wrote upon Philosophy in the
German language. In regard to the matter of the philosophy
of Tschirnhausen and Thomasius we have not much
to say; it is so-called healthy reason—there is in it the
superficial character and the empty universality always to
be found where a beginning is made with thought. In this
case the universality of thought satisfies us because everything
is present there, just as it is present in a moral maxim
which has, however, no determinate content in its universality.
Wolff, then, was the first to make, not exactly
Philosophy, but thoughts in the form of thought, into a
general possession, and he substituted this in Germany for
mere talk originating from feeling, from sensuous perception,
and from the ordinary conception. This is most important
from the point of view of culture, and yet it does not really
concern us here, excepting in so far as the content in this
form of thought has caused itself to be recognized as
Philosophy. This philosophy, as a philosophy of the understanding,
became the ordinary culture of the day; in it
determinate, intelligent thought is the fundamental principle,
and it extends over the whole circle of objects which
fall within the region of knowledge. Wolff defined the
world of consciousness for Germany, and for the world in
general, in the same wide sense in which we may say that
this was done by Aristotle. What distinguishes him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Aristotle is that in so doing the point of view that he
adopted was that of the understanding merely, while
Aristotle treated the subject speculatively. The philosophy
of Wolff is hence no doubt built on foundations laid by
Leibnitz, but yet in such a manner that the speculative
interest is quite eliminated from it. The spiritual philosophy,
substantial in a higher sense, which we found
emerging first in Boehme, though still in a peculiar and
barbarous form, has been quite lost sight of, and has disappeared
without leaving any traces or effects in Germany;
his very language was forgotten.</p>

<p>The principal events in Christian Wolff’s life are these:
He was the son of a baker, and was born at Breslau in
1679. He first studied Theology and then Philosophy, and
in 1707 he became Professor of Mathematics and Philosophy
at Halle. Here the pietistic theologians, and more especially
Lange, treated him in the basest manner. Piety did not trust
this understanding; for piety, if it is true, embodies a content
which is speculative in nature, and which passes beyond
the understanding. As his opponents could make no headway
by their writings, they resorted to intrigues. They
caused it to be conveyed to King Frederick William I., the
father of Frederick II., a rough man who took an interest
in nothing but soldiers, that according to the determinism
of Wolff, free will was impossible, and that soldiers could
not hence desert of their own free will, but by a special
disposition of God (pre-established harmony)—a doctrine
which, if disseminated amongst the military, would be
extremely dangerous. The king, much enraged by this,
immediately issued a decree that within forty-eight hours
Wolff should leave Halle and the Prussian States, under
penalty of the halter. Wolff thus left Halle on the 23rd
of November, 1723. The theologians added to all this
the scandal of preaching against Wolff and his philosophy,
and the pious Franke thanked God on his knees in
church for the removal of Wolff. But the rejoicings did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
not last long. Wolff went to Cassel, was there immediately
installed first professor in the philosophic faculty at
Marburg, and at the same time made a member of the
Academies of Science of London, Paris, and Stockholm.
By Peter the First of Russia he was made Vice-President
of the newly instituted Academy in St. Petersburg. Wolff
was also summoned to Russia, but this invitation he declined;
he received, however, an honorary post, he was
made a Baron by the Elector of Bavaria, and, in short,
loaded with public honours which, more especially at that
time, though even now it is the case, were very much
thought of by the general public, and which were too great
not to make a profound sensation in Berlin. In Berlin a
commission was appointed to pass judgment on the Wolffian
philosophy—for this it had not been possible to eradicate—and
it declared the same to be harmless, that is to say,
free from all danger to state and religion; it also forbade
the theologians to make it a subject of dispute, and altogether
put an end to their clamour. Frederick William
now issued a recall in very respectful terms to Wolff, who,
however, hesitated to comply with it owing to his lack of
confidence in its sincerity. On the accession of Frederick
II. in 1740 he was again recalled in terms of the highest
honour (Lange had meanwhile died), and only then did he
comply. Wolff became Vice-Chancellor of the University,
but he outlived his repute, and his lectures at the end
were very poorly attended. He died in 1754.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Like Tschirnhausen and Thomasius, Wolff wrote a great
part of his works in his mother tongue, while Leibnitz for
the most part wrote only in Latin or French. This is an
important matter, for, as we have already noticed (pp. 114
and 150), it is only when a nation possesses a science in
its own language that it can really be said to belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
it; and in Philosophy most of all this is requisite. For
thought has in it this very moment of pertaining to self-consciousness
or of being absolutely its own; when one’s
own language is the vehicle of expression, as when we
talk of “Bestimmtheit” instead of “Determination,” and
“Wesen” instead of “Essenz,” it is immediately present
to our consciousness that the conceptions are absolutely its
own; it has to deal with these at all times, and they are in
no way foreign to it. The Latin language has a phraseology,
a definite sphere and range of conception; it is at
once taken for granted that when men write in Latin they
are at liberty to be dull; it is impossible to read or write
what men permit themselves to say in Latin. The titles of
Wolff’s philosophic works are perpetually of this nature:
“Rational thoughts on the powers of the human understanding
and their right uses in the knowledge of the
truth,” Halle, 1712, 8vo; “Rational thoughts on God, the
world, and the soul of man, likewise on all things generally,”
Frankfort and Leipzig, 1719; “On the action and conduct
of men,” Halle, 1720; “On Social Life,” Halle, 1720; “On
the operations of Nature,” Halle, 1723, and so on. Wolff
wrote German and Latin quartos on every department of
Philosophy, even on economics—twenty-three thick volumes
of Latin, or about forty quartos altogether. His mathematical
works make a good many more quartos. He
brought into general use the differential and integral calculus
of Leibnitz.</p>

<p>It is only in its general content and taken as a whole
that Wolff’s philosophy is the philosophy of Leibnitz, that
is to say, only in relation to the fundamental determinations
of monads and to the theodicy—to these he remained
faithful; any other content is empiric, derived from our
feelings and desires. Wolff likewise accepted in their
entirety all the Cartesian and other definitions of general
ideas. Hence we find in him abstract propositions and
their proofs mingled with experiences, on the indubitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
truth of which he builds a large part of his propositions;
and he must so build and derive his foundations
if a content is to result at all. With Spinoza, on the
contrary, no content is to be found excepting absolute
substance and a perpetual return into the same. The
greatness of Wolff’s services to the culture of Germany,
which now appeared quite independently and without any
connection with an earlier and profounder metaphysical
standpoint (<i>supra</i>, p. 350), are in proportion to the barrenness
and inward contentless condition into which Philosophy
had sunk. This he divided into its formal disciplines,
spinning it out into determinations of the understanding
with a pedantic application of geometric methods; and,
contemporaneously with the English philosophers, he made
the dogmatism of the metaphysics of the understanding
fashionable, that is a philosophizing which determines the
absolute and rational by means of self-exclusive thought-determinations
and relationships (such as one and many,
simple and compound, finite and infinite, causal connection,
&amp;c.). Wolff entirely displaced the Aristotelian philosophy
of the schools, and made Philosophy into an ordinary
science pertaining to the German nation. But besides this
he gave Philosophy that systematic and requisite division
into sections which has down to the present day served as
a sort of standard.</p>

<p>In theoretic philosophy Wolff first treats of Logic purified
from scholastic interpretations or deductions; it is the logic
of the understanding which he has systematized. The
second stage is Metaphysics, which contains four parts:
first there is Ontology, the treatment of abstract and quite
general philosophic categories, such as Being (ὄν) and its
being the One and Good; in this abstract metaphysic there
further comes accident, substance, cause and effect, the
phenomenon, &amp;c. Next in order is Cosmology, a general
doctrine of body, the doctrine of the world; here we have
abstract metaphysical propositions respecting the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
that there is no chance, no leaps or bounds in nature—the
law of continuity. Wolff excludes natural science and
natural history. The third part of the metaphysic is
rational psychology or pneumatology, the philosophy of
the soul, which deals with the simplicity, immortality, immateriality
of the soul. Finally, the fourth is natural
theology, which sets forth the proofs of the existence of
God.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Wolff also inserts (chap. iii.) an empirical psychology.
Practical philosophy he divides into the Rights of Nature,
Morality, the Rights of Nations or Politics, and
Economics.</p>

<p>The whole is propounded in geometric forms such as
definitions, axioms, theorems, scholia, corollaries, &amp;c. In
mathematics the understanding is in its proper place, for
the triangle must remain the triangle. Wolff on the one
hand started upon a large range of investigation, and one
quite indefinite in character, and on the other, held to a
strictly methodical manner with regard to propositions and
their proofs. The method is really similar to that of
Spinoza, only it is more wooden and lifeless than his.
Wolff applied the same methods to every sort of content—even
to that which is altogether empirical, such as his so-called
applied mathematics, into which he introduces many
useful arts, bringing the most ordinary reflections and
directions into the geometric form. In many cases this
undoubtedly gives his work a most pedantic aspect,
especially when the content directly justifies itself to our
conception without this form at all. For Wolff proceeds
by first laying down certain definitions, which really rest
upon our ordinary conceptions, since these he translated
into the empty form of determinations of the understanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Hence the definitions are merely nominal
definitions, and we know whether they are correct only
by seeing whether they correspond to conceptions which
are referred to their simple thoughts. The syllogism is
the form of real importance in this mode of reasoning, and
with Wolff it often attains to its extreme of rigidity and
formalism.</p>

<p>Under mathematics, which is the subject of four small
volumes, Wolff also treats of architecture and military
science. One of the propositions in Architecture is this:
“Windows must be wide enough for two persons.” The
making of a door is also propounded as a task, and the
solution thereof given. The next best example comes from
the art of warfare. The “Fourth proposition. The
approach to the fortress must always be harder for the
enemy the nearer he comes to it.” Instead of saying,
because the danger is greater, which would be trivial, there
follows the “Proof. The nearer the enemy comes to the
fortress, the greater the danger. But the greater the
danger the greater the resistance that must be offered in
order to defy the attacks, and, so far as may be, avert the
danger. Hence the nearer the enemy is to the fort the
harder must the approach be made for him. Q.E.D.”<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
Since the increase of the danger is given as the reason, the
whole is false, and the contrary may be said with equal
truth. For if at the beginning all possible resistance
is offered to the enemy, he cannot get nearer the fortress
at all, and thus the danger cannot become greater. The
greater resistance has a real cause, and not this foolish one—namely,
that because the garrison is now at closer
quarters, and consequently operates in a narrow field, it
can offer a greater resistance. In this most trivial way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Wolff proceeds with every sort of content. This barbarism
of pedantry, or this pedantry of barbarism, represented
as it is in its whole breadth and extent, necessarily
brought itself into disrepute; and without there being a
definite consciousness of the reason why the geometric
method is not the only and ultimate method of knowledge,
instinct and an immediate consciousness of the foolishness
of its applications caused this method to be set aside.</p>

<h3><a id="c356">3. <span class="smcap">The Popular Philosophy of Germany.</span></a></h3>

<p>Popular philosophy flatters our ordinary consciousness,
makes it the ultimate standard. Although with Spinoza
we begin with presupposed definitions, the content is still
profoundly speculative in nature, and it is not derived from
the ordinary consciousness. In Spinoza thinking is not
merely the form, for the content belongs to thinking itself;
it is the content of thought in itself. In the speculative
content the instinct of reason satisfies itself on its own
account, because this content, as a totality which integrates
itself within itself, at once in itself justifies itself to
thought. The content in Spinoza is only without ground
in so far as it has no external ground, but is a ground in
itself. But if the content is finite, a demand for an external
ground is indicated, since in such a case we desire to
have a ground other than this finite. In its matter the
philosophy of Wolff is indeed a popular philosophy, even
if in form it still makes thought authoritative. Until the
time of Kant the philosophy of Wolff was thus pre-eminent.
Baumgarten, Crusius, and Moses Mendelssohn worked each
of them independently on the same lines as Wolff; the
philosophy of the last-mentioned was popular and graceful
in form. The Wolffian philosophy was thus carried on,
although it had cast off its pedantic methods: no further
progress was however made. The question dealt with
was how perfection could be attained—what it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
to think and what not; metaphysic was reduced
to its slightest consistency and to its completest vacuity, so
that in its texture not a single thread remained secure.
Mendelssohn considered himself, and was considered, the
greatest of philosophers, and was lauded as such by his
friends. In his “Morgenstunden” we really find a dry
Wolffian philosophy, however much these gentlemen
endeavoured to give their dull abstractions a bright Platonic
form.</p>

<p>The forms of Philosophy which we have considered bear
the character which pertains specially to metaphysics, of
proceeding from general determinations of the understanding,
but of combining therewith experience and
observation, or the empiric method in general. One side
of this metaphysic is that the opposites of thought are
brought into consciousness, and that attention is directed
upon the solution of this contradiction. Thought and
Being or extension, God and the world, good and evil, the
power and prescience of God on the one side, and the evil in
the world and human freedom on the other: these contradictions,
the opposites of soul and spirit, things conceived
and things material, and their mutual relation, have
occupied all men’s attention. The solution of these
opposites and contradictions has still to be given, and
God is set forth as the One in whom all these contradictions
are solved. This is what is common to all these
philosophies as far as their main elements are concerned.
Yet we must likewise remark that these contradictions are
not solved in themselves, <i>i.e.</i> that the nullity of the
supposition is not demonstrated in itself, and thereby a
true concrete solution has not come to pass. Even if God
is recognized as solving all contradictions, God as the
solution of these contradictions is a matter of words
rather than something conceived and comprehended. If
God is comprehended in His qualities, and prescience,
omnipresence, omniscience, power, wisdom, goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
justice, &amp;c., are considered as qualities of God Himself, they
simply lead to contradictions; and these contradictions,
Leibnitz (<i>supra</i>, p. 348) sought to remove by saying that
the qualities temper one another, <i>i.e.</i> that they are combined
in such a way that one annuls the other. This, however, is
no real comprehension of such contradiction.</p>

<p>This metaphysic contrasts greatly with the old philosophy
of a Plato or an Aristotle. To the old philosophy we can
always turn again and admit its truth; it is satisfying in
the stage of development it has reached—a concrete centre-point
which meets all the problems set by thought as these
are comprehended. In this modern metaphysic, however,
the opposites are merely developed into absolute contradictions.
God is indeed given as their absolute solution,
but only as an abstract solution, as a Beyond; on this side
all contradictions are, as regards their content, unsolved
and unexplained. God is not comprehended as the One in
whom these contradictions are eternally resolved; He is
not comprehended as Spirit, as the Trinity. It is in Him
alone as Spirit, and as Spirit which is Three in One, that
this opposition of Himself and His Other, the Son, is
contained, and with it the resolution of the same; this
concrete Idea of God as reason, has not as yet found an
entrance into Philosophy.</p>

<p>In order that we may now cast a retrospective glance
over the philosophic efforts of other nations, we shall
apply ourselves to the further progress of Philosophy.
Once more we see Scepticism making its way into
this arid philosophy of the understanding. But this
time it is, properly speaking, in the form of Idealism, or
the determinations are subjective determinations of self-consciousness.
In the place of thought we consequently
find the Notion now making its appearance. Just as with
the Stoics determinateness is held to be an object of
thought, we have in modern times this same manifestation
of thought as the unmoved form of simplicity. Only here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the image or inner consciousness of totality is present, the
absolute spirit which the world has before it as its truth
and to whose Notion it makes its way—this is another
inward principle, another implicitude of mind which it endeavours
to bring forth from itself and for itself, so that
reason is a comprehension of the same, or has the certitude
of being all reality. With the ancients reason (λόγος), as
the implicit and explicit Being of consciousness, had only
an ethereal and formal existence as language, but here it
has certainty as existent substance. Hence with Descartes
there is the unity of the Notion and Being, and with
Spinoza the universal reality. The first commencement of
the Notion of the movement of fixed thoughts in themselves
is found in this, that the movement which, as method,
simply falls outside its object, comes within it, or that self-consciousness
comes within thought. Thought is implicitude
without explicitude, an objective mode bearing
no resemblance to a sensuous thing; and yet it is quite
different from the actuality of self-consciousness. This
Notion which we now find entering into thought, has the
three kinds of form which we still have to consider; in the
first place it has that of individual self-consciousness or
the formal conception generally; secondly, that of universal
self-consciousness, which applies itself to all objects whether
they be objects of thought, determinate conceptions, or
have the form of actuality—that is to say it applies itself
to what is established in thought, to the intellectual world
with the riches of its determinations and looked on as a
Beyond, or to the intellectual world in as far as it is its
realization, the world here and around us. It is in those
two ways, and in those ways alone, that the actual Notion
is present in the succeeding chapter; for not as yet is it
in the third place to be found as taken back into thought,
or as the self-thinking or thought-of Notion. While that
universal self-consciousness is, on the whole, a thought
which grasps and comprehends, this third kind of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
is the Notion itself recognized as constituting reality in its
essence, that is to say as Idealism. These three aspects
again divide themselves as before into the three nations
which alone count in the civilized world. The empirical
and perfectly finite form of Notion pertains to the English;
to the French belongs its form as making an attempt at everything,
as establishing itself in its reality, abolishing all
determination, and therefore being universal, unlimited,
pure self-consciousness; and, lastly, to the German pertains
the entering into itself of this implicitude, the thought of
the absolute Notion.</p>

<h2 class="p4" id="c360">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="head smcap">Transition Period</span></h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> decadence which we find in thought until the philosophy
of Kant is reached, is manifested in what was at this
time advocated in opposition to the metaphysic of the
understanding, and which may be called a general popular
philosophy, a reflecting empiricism, which to a greater or
less extent becomes itself a metaphysic; just as, on the
other hand, that metaphysic, in as far as it extended to
particular sciences, becomes empiricism. As against these
metaphysical contradictions, as against the artificialities of
the metaphysical synthesis, as against the assistance of
God, the pre-established harmony, the best possible world,
&amp;c., as against this merely artificial understanding, we
now find that fixed principles, immanent in mind, have
been asserted or maintained respecting what is felt, intuitively
perceived and honoured in the cultured human
breast. And in distinction to the assertion that we only
find the solution in the Beyond, in God, these concrete
principles of a fixed and permanent content form a reconciliation
here and now, they adopt a position of independence,
and assume an intellectual standing-ground which
they find in what has generally been termed the healthy
human understanding. Such determinations may indeed
be found to be perfectly good and valid if the feelings,
intuitions, heart and understanding of man be morally and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
intellectually fashioned; for in that case better and more
noble feelings and desires may rule in men and a more
universal content may be expressed in these principles.
But when men make what we call sound reason—that
which is by nature implanted in man’s breast—into the
content and the principle, the healthy human understanding
discovers itself to be identical with a feeling and knowledge
belonging to nature. The Indians who worship a cow,
and who expose or slay new-born children, and commit all
sorts of barbarous deeds, the Egyptians who pray to a bird,
the apis, &amp;c., and the Turks as well, all possess a healthy
human understanding similar in nature. But the healthy
human understanding and the natural feeling of rude and
barbarous Turks, when taken as a standard, result in
shocking principles. When we speak of healthy human
understanding, however, of natural feelings, we always
have before our eyes a cultured mind; and those who make
the healthy human reason, the natural knowledge, the
immediate feelings and inspirations found in themselves, into
a rule and standard, do not know that when religion,
morality, and rectitude are discovered to be present in the
human breast, this is due to culture and education, which
are the first to make such principles into natural feelings.
Here natural feelings and the healthy human understanding
are thus made the principle; and much may be recognized
as coming under these heads. This then is the form
taken by Philosophy in the eighteenth century. Taken as
a whole, three points of view have to be considered; in the
first place, Hume must be regarded on his own account,
then the Scottish, and, thirdly, the French philosophy.
Hume is a sceptic; the Scottish philosophy opposes the
scepticism of Hume, the French philosophy has in the
“enlightenment” of Germany (by which expression is indicated
that form of German philosophy which is not
Wolffian metaphysics) an appendage of a feebler form.
Since from the metaphysical God we can make no further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
progress in the concrete, Locke grounds his content on
experience. But that empiricism leads thought to no fixed
standpoint, Hume demonstrates by denying every universal;
the Scottish philosophers, on the contrary, undoubtedly
maintain universal propositions and truths, but not through
thought. Hence in empiricism itself the fixed standpoint
has now to be adopted; thus the French find the universal
in the actuality which they call <i>réalité</i>. They do not, however,
find its content in and from thought, but as living
substance, as nature and matter. All this is a further
working out of reflecting empiricism, and some more details
respecting it must still be given.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c363">A. <span class="smcap">Idealism and Scepticism.</span></a></h2>

<p>Thought generally is simple, universal self-identity, but
in the form of negative movement, whereby the determinate
abrogates itself. This movement of Being-for-self is
now an essential moment of thought, while hitherto it was
outside it; and thus grasping itself as movement in itself,
thought is self-consciousness—at first indeed formal, as
individual self-consciousness. Such a form it has in scepticism,
but this distinction marks it off from the older
scepticism, that now the certainty of reality is made the
starting point. With the ancients, on the contrary, scepticism
is the return into individual consciousness in such
a way that to it this consciousness is not the truth,
in other words that scepticism does not give expression
to the results arrived at, and attains no positive significance.
But since in the modern world this absolute
substantiality, this unity of implicitude and self-consciousness
is fundamental—that is, this faith in reality generally—scepticism
has here the form of idealism, <i>i.e.</i> of expressing
self-consciousness or certainty of self as all reality and
truth. The crudest form of this idealism is when self-consciousness,
as individual or formal, does not proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
further than to say: All objects are our conceptions. We
find this subjective idealism in Berkeley,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and another form
of the same in Hume.</p>

<h3><a id="c364">1. <span class="smcap">Berkeley.</span></a></h3>

<p>This idealism, in which all external reality disappears,
has before it the standpoint of Locke, and it proceeds
directly from him. For we saw that to Locke the source of
truth is experience, or Being as perceived. Now since this
sensuous Being, as Being, has in it the quality of being
for consciousness, we saw that it necessarily came to pass
that in Locke’s case some qualities, at least, were so determined
that they were not in themselves, but only for
another; and that colour, figure, &amp;c., had their ground only in
the subject, in his particular organization. This Being-for-another,
however, was not by him accepted as the Notion,
but as falling within self-consciousness—i.e. self-consciousness
not looked on as universal,—not within mind, but
within what is opposed to the implicit.</p>

<p>George Berkeley was born in 1684 at Kilcrin, near
Thomastown, in the county of Kilkenny, Ireland: in 1754
he died as an English Bishop.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> He wrote the “Theory
of Vision,” 1709; “A Treatise concerning the principles
of human knowledge,” 1710; “Three Dialogues between
Hylas and Philonous,” 1713. In 1784 his collected works
were published in London in two quarto volumes.</p>

<p>Berkeley advocated an idealism which came very near to
that of Malebranche. As against the metaphysic of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
understanding, we have the point of view that all existence
and its determinations arise from feeling, and are constituted
by self-consciousness. Berkeley’s first and fundamental
thought is consequently this: “The Being of
whatever is called by us a thing consists alone in its being
perceived,” <i>i.e.</i> our determinations are the objects of our
knowledge. “All objects of human knowledge are ideas”
(so called by Berkeley as by Locke), “which arise either
from the impressions of the outward senses, or from perceptions
of the inward states and activities of the mind, or
finally, they are such as are constituted by means of
memory and imagination through their separation and rearrangement.
A union of different sensuous feelings appears
to us to be a particular thing, <i>e.g.</i> the feeling of colour,
taste, smell, figure, &amp;c.; for by colours, smells, sounds,
something of which we have a sensation is always understood.”<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
This is the matter and the object of knowledge;
the knower is the percipient “I,” which reveals itself in
relation to those feelings in various activities, such as
imagination, remembrance, and will.</p>

<p>Berkeley thus indeed acknowledges the distinction between
Being-for-self and Other-Being, which in his case,
however, itself falls within the “I.” Of the matter on
which activity is directed, it is no doubt in regard to one
portion allowed that it does not exist outside of mind—that
is to say, so far as our thoughts, inward feelings and
states, or the operations of our imaginary powers are concerned.
But in like manner the manifold sensuous conceptions
and feelings can only exist in a mind. Locke certainly
distinguished extension and movement, for example, as
fundamental qualities, <i>i.e.</i> as qualities which pertain to the
objects in themselves. But Berkeley very pertinently
points out inconsistency here from the point of view that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
great and small, quick and slow, hold good as something
relative; thus were extension and movement to be inherent
or implicit, they could not be either large or small, quick
or slow; that is, they could not be, for these determinations
rest in the conception<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> of such qualities. In Berkeley the
relation of things to consciousness is alone dealt with, and
beyond this relationship they do not in his view come.
From this it follows that it is only self-consciousness that
possesses them; for a perception which is not in a conceiving
mind is nothing: it is a direct contradiction. There
can be no substance, he says, which neither conceives nor
perceives, and which is yet the substratum of perceptions
and conceptions. If it is represented that there is something
outside of consciousness which is similar to the conceptions,
this is likewise contradictory; a conception can
alone be similar to a conception, the idea to the idea
alone.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>Thus, while Locke’s ultimate point is abstract substance,
Being generally with the real determination of a substratum
of accidents, Berkeley declares this substance to be the
most incomprehensible assumption of all; but the incomprehensibility
does not make this Being into an absolute
nullity, nor does it make it in itself incomprehensible.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> For
Berkeley brings forward against the present existence of
external objects only the inconceivability of the relation
of a Being to mind. This inconceivability, however, is
destroyed in the Notion, for the Notion is the negative of
things; and this moved Berkeley and Leibnitz to shut
up the two sides in themselves. There nevertheless
remains a relationship of what is “other” to us; these
feelings do not develop from us as Leibnitz represents, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
are determined through somewhat else. When Leibnitz
speaks of development within the monads, it is nothing
but empty talk; for the monads as they follow in succession
have no inward connection. Each individual is thus
determined through another, and not through us; and it
does not matter what this external is, since it remains a
contingent. Now in relation to the two sides of Leibnitz
which are indifferent to one another, Berkeley says that
such an “other” is quite superfluous. Berkeley calls the
other the objects; but these, he says, cannot be what we call
matter, for spirit and matter cannot come together.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> But
the necessity of conceptions directly contradicts this Being-within-self
of the conceiver; for the Being-within-self is
the freedom of the conceiver; the latter does not, however,
produce the conceptions with freedom; they have for him
the form and determinateness of an independent “other.”
Berkeley likewise does not accept idealism in the subjective
sense, but only in respect that there are spirits which impart
themselves (in the other case the subject forms his own
conceptions), and consequently that it is God alone who
brings to pass such conceptions; thus the imaginations
or conceptions which are produced by us with our individual
activity remain separate from these others,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> <i>i.e.</i>
from the implicit.</p>

<p>This conception gives an instance of the difficulties which
appear in regard to these questions, and which Berkeley
wished to escape from in a quite original way. The inconsistency
in this system God has again to make good;
He has to bear it all away; to Him the solution of the
contradiction is left. In this idealism, in short, the common
sensuous view of the universe and the separation of
actuality, as also the system of thought, of judgments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
devoid of Notion, remain exactly as before; plainly nothing
in the content is altered but the abstract form that
all things are perceptions only.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Such idealism deals with
the opposition between consciousness and its object merely,
and leaves the extension of the conceptions and the antagonisms
of the empirical and manifold content quite untouched;
and if we ask what then is the truth of these
perceptions and conceptions, as we asked formerly of
things, no answer is forthcoming. It is pretty much a
matter of indifference whether we believe in things or in
perceptions, if self-consciousness remains possessed entirely
by finalities; it receives the content in the ordinary way,
and that content is of the ordinary kind. In its individuality
it stumbles about amid the conceptions of an
entirely empirical existence, without knowing and understanding
anything else about the content: that is to say
in this formal idealism reason has no content of its own.</p>

<p>As to what Berkeley further states in respect of the
empirical content, where the object of his investigation
becomes entirely psychological, it relates in the main to
finding out the difference between the sensations of sight
and feeling, and to discovering which kind of sensations
belong to the one and which to the other. This kind of
investigation keeps entirely to the phenomenal, and only
therein distinguishes the various sorts of phenomena; or
comprehension only reaches as far as to distinctions. The
only point of interest is that these investigations have in
their course chiefly lighted on space, and a dispute is
carried on as to whether we obtain the conception of
distance and so on, in short all the conceptions relating
to space, through sight or feeling. Space is just this
sensuous universal, the universal in individuality itself,
which in the empirical consideration of empirical multiplicity
invites and leads us on to thought (for it itself is
thought), and by it this very sensuous perception and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
reasoning respecting perception is in its action confused.
And since here perception finds an objective thought, it
really would be led on to thought or to the possession of a
thought, but at the same time it cannot arrive at thought
in its completion, since thought or the Notion are not
in question, and it clearly cannot come to the consciousness
of true reality. Nothing is thought in the form of
thought, but only as an external, as something foreign to
thought.</p>

<h3><a id="c369">2. <span class="smcap">Hume.</span></a></h3>

<p>We must add to what has preceded an account of the
Scepticism of Hume, which has been given a more important
place in history than it deserves from its intrinsic
nature; its historic importance is due to the fact that
Kant really derives the starting point of his philosophy
from Hume.</p>

<p>David Hume was born in 1711 at Edinburgh and died
there in 1776. He held a librarian’s post in that town
for some time, then he became secretary to the Embassy in
Paris; for quite a long period, indeed, he moved in diplomatic
circles. In Paris he came to know Jean Jacques
Rousseau and invited him to England, but Rousseau’s
terribly distrustful and suspicious nature very soon
estranged the two.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Hume is more celebrated as a writer
of history than through his philosophic works. He wrote:
“A Treatise of human nature,” 3 vols., 1739, translated
into German by Jacob, Halle, 1790, 8vo; likewise “Essays
and Treatises on several subjects,” 2 vols. (Vol. I. containing
“Essays moral, political and literary,” printed for the
first time in Edinburgh, 1742; Vol. II. containing an “Inquiry
concerning human understanding,” a further development
of the Treatise, and first printed separately in London,
1748, 8vo). In his “Essays,” which contributed most to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
his fame as far as the philosophic side is concerned, he
treated philosophic subjects as an educated, thoughtful
man of the world would do—not in a systematic connection,
nor showing the wide range which his thoughts should
properly have been able to attain; in fact in some of his
treatises he merely dealt with particular points of view.</p>

<p>We must shortly deal with the main aspects of Hume’s
philosophy. He starts directly from the philosophic standpoint
of Locke and Bacon, which derives our conceptions
from experience, and his scepticism has the idealism of
Berkeley as its object. The sequence of thought is this:
Berkeley allows all ideas to hold good as they are; in Hume
the antithesis of the sensuous and universal has cleared
and more sharply defined itself, sense being pronounced by
him to be devoid of universality. Berkeley does not make
any distinction as to whether in his sensations there is a
necessary connection or not. Formerly experience was a
mixture of the two elements. Hume tells us that all
perceptions of the mind may be divided into two classes
or species, that of impressions, <i>i.e.</i> sensuous perceptions,
and thoughts or ideas; the latter are similar in content
to the former, but less forcible and lively. All objects of
reason are consequently either relations of thoughts such
as mathematical axioms, or facts of experience.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Since
Hume makes these into the content he naturally rejects
innate ideas.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Now when Hume goes on to consider more closely what is
subsumed under experience, he finds categories of the
understanding present there, and more especially the
determination of the universal and of universal necessity;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
he took under his consideration more particularly the
category of cause and effect, and in it set forth the
rational element, inasmuch as in this causal relationship
necessity is especially contained. Here Hume really
completed the system of Locke, since he consistently drew
attention to the fact that if this point of view be adhered
to, experience is indeed the principle of whatever one
knows, or perception itself contains everything that
happens, but nevertheless the determination of universality
and necessity are not contained in, nor were they given us
by experience. Hume has thus destroyed the objectivity
or absolute nature of thought-determinations. “Our conviction
of the truth of a fact rests on feeling, memory, and
the reasonings founded on the causal connection, <i>i.e.</i> on the
relation of cause and effect. The knowledge of this relation
is not attained by reasonings <i>a priori</i>, but arises
entirely from experience; and we draw inferences, since we
expect similar results to follow from similar causes, by
reason of the principle of the custom or habit of conjoining
different manifestations, <i>i.e.</i> by reason of the principle of
the association of ideas. Hence there is no knowledge and
no metaphysics beyond experience.”<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>The simple thought we have here is exactly what
Locke says, that we must receive the conception of cause
and effect, and thus of a necessary connection, from experience;
but experience, as sensuous perception, contains
no necessity, has no causal connection. For in what we
term such, that which we properly speaking perceive is
merely the fact that something first of all happens and
that then something else follows. Immediate perception
relates only to a content of conditions or things which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
present alongside of and in succession to one another, but
not to what we call cause and effect; in time-succession
there is thus no relation of cause and effect, and consequently
no necessity either.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> When we say the pressure
of the water is the cause of the destruction of this house,
that is no pure experience. We have merely seen the
water pressing or moving along in this direction, and
subsequently the house falling down; and so with other
examples. Necessity is thus not justified by experience,
but we carry it into experience; it is accidentally arrived at
by us and is subjective merely. This kind of universality
which we connect with necessity, Hume calls custom.
Because we have often seen results to follow we are
accustomed to regard the connection as a necessary one;
the necessity to him is thus a quite contingent association
of ideas, which is custom.</p>

<p>It is the same thing in respect of the universal. What
we perceive are individual phenomena and sensations in
which we see that this is now one thing and now another.
It may likewise be that we perceive the same determination
frequently repeated and in manifold ways. But this
is still far removed from universality; universality is a
determination which is not given to us through experience.
It may be said that this is quite a correct remark on
Hume’s part, if by experience we understand outward
experience. Experience is sensible that something exists,
but nevertheless the universal is not as yet present in it.
Indeed, sensuous existence as such is something which
is set forth as indifferent, not differentiated from anything
else; but sensuous existence is likewise universal in itself,
or the indifference of its determinateness is not its only
determinateness. But since Hume regards necessity, the
unity of opposites, as resting quite subjectively on custom,
we cannot get any deeper in thought. Custom is indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
so far a necessity in consciousness, and to this extent we
really see the principle of this idealism in it; but in the
second place this necessity is represented as something
quite devoid of thought or Notion.</p>

<p>This custom obtains both in our perception which relates
to sensuous nature, and in relation to law and morality. The
ideas of justice and morality rest upon an instinct, on a
subjective, but very often deceptive moral feeling.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> From
a sceptical point of view the opposite may likewise be
demonstrated. From this side Hume considers justice,
morality, religious determinations, and disputes their
absolute validity. That is to say when it is assumed that
our knowledge arises from experience, and that we must
consider only what we obtain thereby to be the truth, we
find indeed in our feeling, the sentiment <i>e.g.</i> that the
murderer, the thief, &amp;c., must be punished; and because
this is likewise felt by others it is universally allowed.
But Hume, like the sceptics of former days, appeals to the
various opinions of various nations: amongst different
nations and in different times various standards of right
have been held.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> There are those who in this case do not
have the feeling of wrong-doing in respect of stealing, <i>e.g.</i>
the Lacedæmonians or the so-called innocent inhabitants
of the South Sea Islands. What is by one nation called
immoral, shameful and irreligious, is by another not considered
so at all. Thus because such matters rest upon
experience, one subject has such and such an experience,
finds, for instance, in his religious feelings this determination
which inclines him to God, while another subject
has different experiences altogether. We are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
habit of allowing one thing to be just and moral, others
have another mode of regarding it. Hence if the truth
depends upon experience, the element of universality, of
objectivity, &amp;c., comes from elsewhere, or is not justified
by experience. Hume thus declared this sort of universality,
as he declared necessity, to be rather subjectively
than objectively existent; for custom is just a subjective
universality of this kind. This is an important and acute
observation in relation to experience looked at as the
source of knowledge; and it is from this point that the
Kantian reflection now begins.</p>

<p>Hume (Essays and Treatises on several subjects, Vol. III.
Sect. 8, 11) then extended his scepticism to the conceptions
and doctrines of freedom and necessity, and to the proofs
of the existence of God; and in fact scepticism here
possesses a wide field. To such a system of reasoning
from thoughts and possibilities another method of reasoning
may again be opposed, and this reasoning is no better
than the other. What is said to be metaphysically established
regarding immortality, God, nature, &amp;c., lacks a real
ground for resting upon, such as is professed to be given;
for the inferences on which men ground their proofs
are subjectively formed conceptions. But where a universality
is found, it does not rest in the matter in itself,
but is simply a subjective necessity which is really mere
custom. Hence the result which Hume arrives at is
necessarily astonishment regarding the condition of
human knowledge, a general state of mistrust, and a
sceptical indecision—which indeed does not amount to
much. The condition of human knowledge regarding
which Hume so much wonders, he further describes as
containing an antagonism between reason and instinct;
this instinct, it is said, which embraces many sorts of
powers, inclinations, &amp;c., deceives us in many different
ways, and reason demonstrates this. But on the other
side it is empty, without content or principles of its own;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
and if a content is in question at all, it must keep to those
inclinations. In itself reason thus has no criterion whereby
the antagonism between individual desires, and between
itself and the desires, may be settled.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Thus everything
appears in the form of an irrational existence devoid of
thought; the implicitly true and right is not in thought,
but in the form of an instinct, a desire.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c375">B. <span class="smcap">Scottish Philosophy.</span></a></h2>

<p>In Scotland quite another school of thought developed,
and the Scotch are the foremost of Hume’s opponents; in
German philosophy, on the other hand, we have to recognize
in Kant another opposing force to that of Hume. To the
Scottish school many philosophers belong; English
philosophy is now restricted to Edinburgh and Glasgow, in
which places a number of professors belonging to this
school succeeded one another. To the scepticism of Hume
they oppose an inward independent source of truth for all
that pertains to religion and morality. This coincides with
Kant, who also maintains an inward source or spring as
against external perception; but in the case of Kant this
has quite another form than that which it possesses with the
Scottish philosophers. To them this inward independent
source is not thought or reason as such, for the content
which comes to pass from this inwardness is concrete in its
nature, and likewise demands for itself the external matter
of experience. It consists of popular principles, which on
the one hand are opposed to the externality of the sources
of knowledge, and, on the other, to metaphysics as such,
to abstract thought or reasoning on its own account. This
sort of reasoning understanding applied itself to ethics and
to politics—sciences which have been much developed by
German, French, and above all by Scottish philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
(<i>supra</i>, p. 320): they regarded morality as cultured men
would, and sought to bring moral duties under a principle.
Many of their works are translated into German; several
of these on ethics or morality are translated by Garve,
for instance, who also translated Cicero <i>De Officiis</i>, and
they are written in a manner similar to that of Cicero when
he uses the expression <i>Insitum est a natura</i> (Vol. I. p. 93).
This moral sentiment and the ordinary human understanding
hereafter formed the common principle to a
whole succession of Scots, such as Thomas Reid, Beattie,
Oswald, and others; in this way they frequently made
sagacious observations, but with them speculative
philosophy quite disappears. One special characteristic of
these Scottish philosophers is that they have sought
accurately to define the principle of knowledge; but on the
whole they start from the same point as that which was in
Germany likewise accepted as the principle. That is to
say they represented the so-called healthy reason, or
common-sense (<i>sensus communis</i>), as the ground of truth.
The following are the principal members of this school, each
of whom has some special feature distinguishing him from
the rest.</p>

<h3><a id="c376">1. <span class="smcap">Thomas Reid.</span></a></h3>

<p>Thomas Reid, born in 1710, died as a professor in
Glasgow in 1796.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> He maintained the principle of common-sense.
His endeavour was to discover the principles of
knowledge, and the following are his conclusions: “(a) There
are certain undemonstrated and undemonstrable fundamental
truths which common-sense begets and recognizes
as immediately conclusive and absolute.” This hence constitutes
an immediate knowledge; in it an inward independent
source is set forth which is hereby opposed to
religion as revealed. “(b) These immediate truths require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
no support from any elaborated science, nor do they submit
to its criticism;” they cannot be criticized by philosophy.
“(c) Philosophy itself has no root other than that of an
immediate, self-enlightening truth; whatever contradicts
such truth is in itself false, contradictory, and absurd.”
This is true for knowledge and “(d) Morality; the
individual is moral if he acts in accordance with the perfect
principles of the perfection of the whole and with his own
duty as it is known to him.”<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c377a">2. <span class="smcap">James Beattie.</span></a></h3>

<p>James Beattie, born 1735, was a professor of moral
philosophy in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and died in 1803.
He likewise made common-sense the source of all knowledge.
“The common-sense of the plain human understanding
is the source of all morality, of all religion, and all
certainty. The confirmation of common-sense must be
added to the testimony of our senses. The truth is what
the necessities of my nature call upon me to believe.
Belief signifies conviction in the case of truths which are
certain, in that of those which are probable, approbation.
The truth which is certain is known by means of intuition,
the probable truth by means of proofs.”<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Such convictions
as are quite certain form the basis of actions.</p>

<h3><a id="c377b">3. <span class="smcap">James Oswald.</span></a></h3>

<p>James Oswald, a Scottish clergyman, made use of an
expression which indicates that we have the principles just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
mentioned as facts existing within us.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> “The existence of
the Divine Being is (according to him) a fact absolutely
raised above all reasoning and all doubt, and immediately
certain for the common-sense of morality.”<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The
same principle was likewise established in Germany at this
time—an inward revelation, a knowledge of the conscience,
and specially of God and His Being.</p>

<h3><a id="c378">4. <span class="smcap">Dugald Stewart.</span></a></h3>

<p>To this school also belong Dugald Stewart, Edward
Search,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Ferguson, and Hutcheson, most of whom have
written on morals. The political economist Adam Smith
from this point of view is likewise a philosopher, and the
best known of them all. This Scottish philosophy is now
given forth in Germany as something new. It is a popular
philosophy, which, on the one hand, has the great merit of
seeking in man, and in his consciousness, for the source of
all that should be held by him as true, the immanence of
what should be by him esteemed. The content is at the
same time a concrete content; in a certain degree, it is the
antithesis of metaphysics proper, of the wandering about in
abstract determinations of the understanding. Of these
Scots, Dugald Stewart, who is living still,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> appears to be
the last and least significant; in them all there is the same
ground-work to be found, the same circle of reflection,
namely, an <i>a priori</i> philosophy, though not one which is to
be pursued in a speculative way. The general idea which
pervades their principle is that of the healthy human understanding;
to this they have added benevolent desires, sympathy,
a moral sense, and from such grounds composed very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
excellent moral writings. That is certainly all very well in
order to understand approximately, up to a certain degree
of culture, what universal thoughts are, in order to narrate
their history, to appeal to examples, and to explain them;
but further it does not extend.</p>

<p>In more recent times this Scottish philosophy has passed
to France, and Professor Royer-Collard, now president of
the Second Chamber,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> as also his disciple, Jouffroy, in conformity
with it, pass from the facts of consciousness through
cultured reasoning and experience, to a further stage in
development. What by the French is called <i>Idéologie</i>
(<i>supra</i>, p. 308) has also its place here; it is abstract metaphysics,
in so far as it is an enumeration and analysis of the
most simple thought-determinations. They are not treated
dialectically, but from our reflection, from our thoughts, the
material is derived, and in this the determinations therein
contained are demonstrated.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c379">C. <span class="smcap">French Philosophy.</span></a></h2>

<p>We pass on to the French philosophy; the relation it
bears to metaphysics is this, that while man as a metaphysician
stands to himself in the attitude of a layman or
outsider, French philosophy does away with the lay or
outside position in regard alike to politics, religion, and
philosophy. Two forms have to be mentioned which are
of the greatest importance in respect to culture—French
philosophy and the <i>Aufklärung</i>. With the English we
saw a certain idealism only: this was either formal, as the
mere general translation of Being into Being-for-another,
<i>i.e.</i> into perceptibility, or else what is implicit in this perceptibility,
instincts, impulses, habits, &amp;c.—blind determinate
forces; a return into self-consciousness, which itself
appears as a physical thing. In that first idealism the
whole finitude and extension of appearances, of sensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and likewise of thoughts and determinate fixed conceptions,
remain just what they are in the unphilosophic consciousness.
The scepticism of Hume makes all that is universal
sink into habits and instincts, <i>i.e.</i> it consists in a more
simple synthesis of the phenomenal world; but these
simpler elements, these instincts, impulses, and forces, are
just as much a fixed present existence in self-consciousness,
unspiritual, and without movement. The French philosophy
has more life, more movement, more spirit; it would
perhaps be more correct to describe it as full of life and
spirit. It is the absolute Notion, which revolts against
the whole reigning system of prevalent conceptions and
established ideas, which overthrows all that has settled
into fixity, and acquires the consciousness of perfect liberty.
At the root of this idealistic activity lies the certainty that
whatever is, whatever counts for anything in itself, is
all a matter of self-consciousness; and as to Notions
(individual and isolated existences ruling actual self-consciousness),
such as the Notions of good and evil,
of power and riches, and the fixed conceptions regarding
faith in God and His relation to the world, His
mode of government and, further, the duties of self-consciousness
towards Him—that all these are not truths
in themselves, having validity beyond the bounds of self-consciousness.
All these forms, the real implicitude of the
actual world and also of the supersensuous world, are
therefore set aside in this spirit conscious of itself. It
does not trouble itself seriously about those who admit the
validity of these conceptions just as they are, and accept
them as true, respecting them as independent and free
apart from self-consciousness, but it speaks of such conceptions
with intelligence and spirit, that is to say, it
asserts that self-consciousness by its activity is the first to
make anything of them, and to make that a something
very different from what they profess to be; for the self-conscious
spirit only intellectual relations, these processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
of formation and movement by means of its self-consciousness,
possess validity and interest. This is the character
of the Notion in its actuality; what has reality for this
all-perceiving and all-comprehending consciousness is held
to be valid.</p>

<p>We must now consider what form existence takes for
this absolutely comprehending self-consciousness. In the
first place this Notion is fixed as the negative movement
of the Notion only; the positive and simple, or existence,
falls outside of this movement. There remains to the
Notion no distinction, no content; for all determinate
content is lost in that negativity. This empty existence
is for us pure thought generally, what the French call
<i>être suprême</i>, or if represented objectively as existent, and
as in opposition to consciousness, it is matter. Absolute
Being is therefore determined as matter, as empty objectivity,
through a Notion which destroys all content
and determination, and has as its object this universal
alone. It is a Notion which acts only destructively, and
does not again construct itself out of this matter or pure
thought or pure substantiality. We here see so-called
materialism and atheism freely emerge, as the necessary
result of the pure comprehending self-consciousness. From
one point of view there perishes in this negative movement
all determination which represents spirit as something
beyond self-consciousness, and more especially all determinations
within the spirit, and also those which express
it as spirit, indeed all the conceptions formed of it by faith,
for which it has validity as an existent self-consciousness
beyond self-consciousness—in short, all that is traditional
or imposed by authority. There remains only a present,
actual Being, for self-consciousness recognizes implicit
existence only in the form which it has for self-consciousness,
and in which it is actually known to itself; in matter,
and matter as actively extending and realizing itself in
multiplicity, <i>i.e.</i> as nature. In the present I am conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to myself of my reality, and consequently self-consciousness
finds itself as matter, finds the soul to be material, and
conceptions to be movements and changes in the inner
organ of the brain, which result from external impressions
on the senses. Thought is therefore a mode of the existence
of matter. The One Substance of Spinoza, to which
French materialism as naturalism is parallel, really finds its
accomplishment here in this object as in all respects the
ultimate; but while in Spinoza this category is a possession
which we find ready to hand, here it appears as the
result of the abstraction of the understanding proceeding
from empiricism.</p>

<p>The other form of the <i>Aufklärung</i> is, on the contrary,
when absolute Being is set forth as something beyond
self-consciousness, so that of itself, of its implicit Being,
nothing whatever can be known. It bears the empty name
of God. For though God may be determined in any way
whatever, all these determinations fall away; He is, like <i>x</i>,
the altogether unknown quantity. This view is not therefore
to be termed atheism, in the first place because it
still employs the empty, meaningless name, and in the
second place because it expresses the necessary relations
of self-consciousness, duties, &amp;c., not as necessary in an
absolute sense, but as necessary through relation to another,
namely to the unknown—although there can be no positive
relation to an unknown except by abrogating the self as
particular. Yet it is not matter, because this simple and
empty something is negatively defined as non-existent for
self-consciousness. This all comes to the same thing,
however, for matter is the universal, and is Being-for-self
represented as abrogated. But the true reflection on that
unknown is this, that it exists for self-consciousness
simply as a negative of the same, <i>i.e.</i> as matter, reality,
the present; it is this negative for me, this is its Notion.
The difference distinguishing this from what appears to be
in its entirety something “other,” and in which any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
side is not permitted to say that what it thinks is such is
that particular thing, is the difference which rests on this
last abstraction.</p>

<p>Since then the Notion is present only in its negative
form, positive extension remains without a Notion; it has
the form of nature, of an existent, both in the physical and
in the moral sphere. The knowledge of nature remains
the ordinary, scientifically unspeculative knowledge, and
as to its essence, in so far as it claims to be philosophy, it
is a general way of speaking that plays with the words,
“forces, relations, manifold connections,” but arrives at
nothing definite. Similarly, in the spiritual sphere, it is
so far true that the metaphysic of the spirit is of such a
nature that it is nothing more nor less than a particular
organization by means of which the powers which are
termed sensation, perception, &amp;c., come into existence; but
this is a wearisome way of talking, which can make nothing
intelligible, which accepts appearances and perceptions
and reasons about them, but none the less reduces their
implicit existence to certain determinate forces, of the
inward nature of which we know nothing further. The
determination and knowledge of the moral sphere has
similarly for its object to bring man back to his so-called
natural promptings; its essence has the form of a natural
impulse, and this natural impulse is termed self-love,
selfishness, or benevolence. It is required that man should
live in conformity with nature; but this nature does not
reach further than general expressions and descriptions,
such as the state of nature we find depicted by Rousseau.
What is called the metaphysic of ordinary conceptions is
the empiricism of Locke, which seeks to show their origin
to be in consciousness, in as far as it is individual consciousness;
which, when born into the world, emerges out of
unconsciousness in order to acquire knowledge as sensuous
consciousness. This external origin they confound with
the Becoming and Notion of the matter in point. If one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
were to ask vaguely what is the origin and genesis of
water, and the answer were to be given that it comes from
the mountains or from rain, this would be a reply in the
spirit of the above philosophy. In short, it is only the
negative aspect that is interesting, and as for this positive
French philosophy, it is out of the question. But even
the negative side of it belongs properly to culture mainly,
with which we have here nothing to do, and the <i>Aufklärung</i>
likewise belongs to the same. In the French philosophic
writings, which in this respect are of importance, what is
worthy of admiration is the astonishing energy and force
of the Notion as directed against existence, against faith,
against all the power of authority that had held sway for
thousands of years. On the one hand we cannot help
remarking the feeling of utter rebellion against the whole
state of affairs at present prevailing, a state which is alien
to self-consciousness, which would fain dispense with it,
and in which self-consciousness does not find itself; there
is a certainty of the truth of reason, which challenges the
whole intellectual world as it stands aloof, and is confident
of destroying it. French atheism, materialism, or naturalism
has overcome all prejudices, and has been victorious over
the senseless hypotheses and assumptions of the positive
element in religion, which is associated with habits,
manners, opinions, determinations as to law and morality
and civil institutions. With the healthy human understanding
and earnestness of spirit, and not with frivolous
declamations, it has rebelled against the condition of the
world as legally established, against the constitution of
the state, the administration of justice, the mode of government,
political authority, and likewise against art.</p>

<p>Contrasting with this barren content there is the other
and fertile side. The positive is in its turn constituted by
so-called immediately enlightening truths of the healthy
human understanding, which contains nothing except this
truth and the claim to find itself, and beyond this form does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
not pass. But in so doing there arises the endeavour to
grasp the absolute as something present, and at the same
time as an object of thought and as absolute unity: an
endeavour which, as it implies denial of the conception of
design both in the natural and in the spiritual sphere—the
former involving the idea of life, and the latter that of
spirit and freedom—only reaches to the abstraction of a
nature undetermined in itself, to sensation, mechanism,
self-seeking, and utility. It is this then that we shall have
to make evident in the positive side of French philosophy.
In their political constitutions the French have, it is true,
started from abstractions, but they have done so as from
universal thoughts, which are the negative of reality; the
English, on the other hand, proceed from concrete reality,
from the unwieldy structure of their constitution; just as
their writers even have not attained to universal principles.
What Luther began in the heart only and in the feelings—the
freedom of spirit which, unconscious of its simple root,
does not comprehend itself, and yet is the very universal
itself, for which all content disappears in the thought that
fills itself with itself—these universal determinations and
thoughts the French asserted and steadfastly adhered to:
they are universal principles, in the form of the conviction
of the individual in himself. Freedom becomes the condition
of the world, connects itself with the world’s
history and forms epochs in the same; it is the concrete
freedom of the spirit, a concrete universality; fundamental
principles as regards the concrete now take the place
of the abstract metaphysic of Descartes. Among the
Germans we find mere chatter; they would have liked to
offer explanations also, but all they have to give is in the
form of miserable phenomena and individualism. The
French, from their starting-point of the thought of universality,
and the German liberty of conscience starting
from the conscience which teaches us to “Prove all things,”
to “hold fast that which is good,” have, however, joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
hands with one another, or they follow the same path.
Only the French, as though they were without conscience,
have made short work of everything, and have systematically
adhered to a definite thought—the physiocratic
system; while the Germans wish to leave themselves a
free retreat, and examine from the standpoint of conscience
whether a certain course is permissible. The French warred
against the speculative Notion with the spirit, the Germans
did so with the understanding. We find in the French a
deep all-embracing philosophic need, different from anything
in the English and Scotch and even in the Germans,
and full of vitality: it is a universal concrete view of
all that exists, with entire independence both of all
authority and of all abstract metaphysics. The method
employed is that of development from perception, from the
heart; it is a comprehensive view of the entire matter,
which keeps the whole ever in sight, and seeks to uphold
and attain to it.</p>

<p>This healthy human understanding, this sound reason,
with its content taken from the human breast, from natural
feeling, has directed itself against the religious side of
things in various moments: on the one hand and first of
all, as French philosophy, it did so against the Catholic
religion, the fetters of superstition and of the hierarchy;
on the other hand, in less pronounced form, as the German
“illumination,” against the Protestant religion, in as far as
it has a content which it has derived from revelation, from
ecclesiastical authority in general. On the one hand the
form of authority in general was challenged, and on the
other hand its matter. The content can be easily enough
disposed of by this form of thought, which is not what we
understand by reason, but which must be termed understanding;
it is easy for the understanding to show
objections to the ultimate principles of what can be comprehended
only by means of speculation. The understanding
has thus tried the content of religion by its standard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
has condemned it; the understanding proceeds in the
same way against a concrete philosophy. What of religion
has in many theologies been very commonly left remaining
is what is termed theism, faith in general; this is
the same content which is found also in Mohammedanism.
But along with this attack upon religion on the part of the
reasoning understanding there has been also a movement
towards materialism, atheism and naturalism. It is true
that we should not make the charge of atheism lightly, for
it is a very common occurrence that an individual whose
ideas about God differ from those of other people is
charged with lack of religion, or even with atheism. But
here it really is the case that this philosophy has developed
into atheism, and has defined matter, nature, &amp;c., as
that which is to be taken as the ultimate, the active, and
the efficient. Some Frenchmen, Rousseau for instance, are
not, however, to be included with the rest; one of this
author’s works, “The Confession of Faith of a Vicar,”<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
contains the very same theism which is found in German
theologians. Thus French metaphysics finds a parallel not
only in Spinoza (<i>supra</i>, p. 382) but also in the German
metaphysics of Wolff. Other Frenchmen have confessedly
gone over to naturalism; among them is specially to be
mentioned Mirabaud, to whom the <i>Système de la Nature</i> is
attributed.</p>

<p>In what has been termed French philosophy, represented
by Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, d’Alembert, Diderot,
and in what subsequently appeared in Germany as the
<i>Aufklärung</i>, and has been also stigmatized as atheism, we
may now distinguish three aspects, first, the negative side,
to which most exception has been taken; secondly, the
positive side; thirdly, the philosophical, metaphysical
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="c388">1. <span class="smcap">The Negative Aspect.</span></a></h3>

<p>Justice must be done even to this negative side, as to
everything else; what is substantial in it is the attack of
the reasoning instinct against a condition of degeneracy,
I may even say of utter and universal falsehood; for
instance, against the positive side of a religion that has
become wooden and lifeless. What we call religion is firm
faith, conviction that there is a God; if this is faith in the
doctrines of Christianity, it is more or less abstracted from.
But in this attack against religion we have to think of something
quite different from the above; in what we find
here, the positive of religion is the negative of reason. If
we would understand the feeling of indignation to which
these writers give utterance, we must keep before our eyes
the state of religion in those days, with its might and
magnificence, the corruption of its manners, its avarice, its
ambition, its luxury, for which nevertheless reverence was
claimed—a state of contradiction present and existent.
We perceive into what a frightful condition of formalism
and deadness positive religion had sunk, as had the bonds
of society as well, the means employed for the administration
of justice, the power of the state. This French
philosophy also attacked the state; it assailed prejudices
and superstition, especially the depravity of civic life, of
court manners and of Government officials; it laid hold of
and brought to light the evil, the ridiculous, the base, and
exposed the whole tissue of hypocrisy and unjust power to
the derision, the contempt and the hatred of the world at
large, and thus brought men’s minds and hearts into a
state of indifference to the idols of the world and indignation
against them. Old institutions, which in the sense of self-conscious
freedom and humanity that had developed, no
longer found a place, and which had formerly been founded
and upheld by mutual good feeling and the obtuseness of a
consciousness unconscious of self, institutions which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
no longer in harmony with the spirit that had established
them, and now, in consequence of the advance that had
been made in scientific culture, were bound to make good
to reason their claim to be sacred and just,—this was the
formalism that those philosophers overthrew. In making
their attacks, they wrote sometimes with reasoned argument,
sometimes satirically, sometimes in the language of
plain common-sense, and they did not wage war on what
we call religion; that was left quite unharmed, and its
claims were urged with words of choicest eloquence.
Those who enforced these views were therefore agents of
destruction against that alone which was in itself already
destroyed. We place it to our credit when we reproach
the French for their attacks upon religion and on the state.
We must represent to ourselves the horrible state of
society, the misery and degradation in France, in order to
appreciate the services that these writers rendered. Hypocrisy
and cant, imbecility of mind and the tyranny which
sees itself robbed of its prey, may say that attacks were
made on religion, on the state, and on manners. But what
a religion! Not the religion that Luther purified, but the
most wretched superstition, priestly domination, stupidity,
degradation of mind, and more especially the squandering of
riches and the revelling in temporal possessions in the
midst of public misery. And what a state! The blindest
tyranny of ministers and their mistresses, wives and
chamberlains; so that a vast army of petty tyrants and
idlers looked upon it as a right divinely given them to
plunder the revenues of the state and lay hands upon the
product of the nation’s sweat. The shamelessness, the
dishonesty were past belief; and morals were simply in
keeping with the corruptness of the institutions. We see
the law defied by individuals in respect to civil and
political life; we see it likewise set at nought in respect
to conscience and thought.</p>

<p>In regard to practical politics, the writers in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
never even thought of a revolution, but desired and
demanded reforms alone, and that these should be subjective
mainly; they called on the Government to sweep away
abuses, and appoint honourable men as ministers. The
positive recommendations made by them as to the course
to be pursued were, for example, that the royal children
should receive a good upbringing, that princes should be of
frugal habits, &amp;c. The French Revolution was forced on
by the stiff-necked obstinacy of prejudices, by haughtiness,
utter want of thought, and avarice. The philosophers of
whom we are speaking were able to give only a general
idea of what ought to be done; they could not indicate the
mode in which the reforms were to be carried out. It was
the Government’s business to make arrangements and carry
out reforms in concrete shape; but it did not perceive this.
What the philosophers brought forward and maintained as
a remedy for this horrible state of disorder was, speaking
generally, that men should no longer be in the position
of laymen, either with regard to religion or to law; so
that in religious matters there should not be a hierarchy,
a limited and selected number of priests, and in the same
way that there should not be in legal matters an exclusive
caste and society (not even a class of professional lawyers),
in whom should reside, and to whom should be restricted,
the knowledge of what is eternal, divine, true, and right,
and by whom other men should be commanded and directed;
but that human reason should have the right of giving its
assent and its opinion. To treat barbarians as laymen is
quite as it should be—barbarians are nothing but laymen;
but to treat thinking men as laymen is very hard. This
great claim made by man to subjective freedom, perception
and conviction, the philosophers in question contended for
heroically and with splendid genius, with warmth and fire,
with spirit and courage, maintaining that a man’s own self,
the human spirit, is the source from which is derived all that
is to be respected by him. There thus manifests itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
them the fanaticism of abstract thought. We Germans
were passive at first with regard to the existing state of
affairs, we endured it; in the second place, when that state
of affairs was overthrown, we were just as passive: it was
overthrown by the efforts of others, we let it be taken
away from us, we suffered it all to happen.</p>

<p>In Germany, Frederick II. allied himself with this culture,
a rare example in those days. French court manners,
operas, gardens, dresses, were widely adopted in Germany,
but not French philosophy; yet in the form of wit and jest
much of it found its way into this upper world, and much
that was evil and barbarous was driven away. Frederick
II., without having been brought up on melancholy psalms,
without having had to learn one or two of them every day
by heart, without the barbarous metaphysics and logic of
Wolff (for what did he find to admire in Germany except
Gellert?), was well acquainted with the great, although
formal and abstract principles of religion and the state,
and governed in accordance therewith, as far as circumstances
allowed. Nothing else was at that time required
in his nation; one cannot ask that he should have reformed
and revolutionized it, since not a single person yet demanded
representative government and the publicity of
courts of justice. He introduced what there was need of,
religious tolerance, legislation, improvements in the administration
of justice, economy in the revenues of state; of the
wretched German law there remained no longer in his
states even the merest phantom. He showed what was the
object and purpose of the state, and at the same time cast
down all privileges, the private rights which pertained to
Germans, and arbitrary statute laws. It is foolish when cant
and German pseudo-patriotism pounce down upon him now,
and try to disparage the greatness of a man whose influence
was so enormous, and would even detract from his
fame by a charge of vanity and wickedness. What German
patriotism aims at should be reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<h3><a id="c392">2. <span class="smcap">The Positive Aspect.</span></a></h3>

<p>The affirmative content of this philosophy certainly does
not satisfy the requirements of profundity. A leading
characteristic of its teaching, which is found also with the
Scottish philosophers and with ourselves, is the assumption
of primitive feelings of justice which man has in himself, as
for example benevolence and social instincts which should
be cultivated. The positive source of knowledge and of
justice is placed in human reason and the common consciousness
of mankind, in the healthy human reason, and not
in the form of the Notion. It is certainly wonderful to
find truths expressed in the form of universal thoughts,
respecting which it is of infinite importance that they
should be assumptions present in the human mind: that
man has in his heart the feeling of right, of love to his
fellow-creatures: that religion and faith are not matters of
compulsion; that merit, talent, virtue are the true nobility,
&amp;c. An important question, especially among the Germans,
was what is the end and character of man, by which was
meant the nature of his mind and spirit; and certainly, as
far as the spiritual is concerned, it is to this point that we
must return. But in order to find the nature of spirit, to
discover what this determination is, a return was made to
perception, observation, experience, to the existence of
certain impulses. These are certainly determinations in
ourselves, but we have not known them in their necessity.
Such an impulse is besides taken as natural, and thus it is
here indeterminate in itself, it has its limitation only as
a moment of the whole. In regard to knowledge, very
abstract thoughts are to be found—though of a truth they
are quite as good as ours, and more ingenious—which according
to their content ought to be concrete, and also were
so. But so superficially were they comprehended that they
soon showed themselves far from sufficient for what had to
be derived from them. They said, for instance, that Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
is a whole, that all is determined by laws, through a combination
of different movements, through a chain of causes
and effects, and so on; the various properties, materials,
connections of things bring everything to pass. These are
general phrases, with which one can fill whole books.</p>

<h4><a id="c393">a. <span class="smcap">Système de la Nature.</span></a></h4>

<p>To this philosophy belongs the <i>Système de la Nature</i>, the
leading work on the subject, written in Paris by a German,
Baron von Hollbach, who was the central figure of all those
philosophers. Montesquieu, d’Alembert, Rousseau, were for
a time in his circle; however much these men were moved
to indignation at the existing state of things, they were yet
in other respects very different from one another. The
<i>Système de la Nature</i> may very easily be found tiresome to
read, because it treats discursively of general conceptions,
which are often repeated; it is not a French book, for
vivacity is lacking and the mode of presentation is dull.</p>

<p>The great Whole of Nature (<i>le grand tout de la nature</i>) is
the ultimate: “The universe displays nothing but an
immense collection of matter and motion” (as with
Descartes), “an unbroken chain of causes and effects, of
which causes some directly affect our senses, while others
are unknown to us, because their effects, which we perceive,
are too remote from their causes. The different
qualities of these materials, their manifold connections, and
the effects which result therefrom, constitute essences for
us. From the diversity of these essences arise the different
orders, species, systems, under which things fall, and whose
sum total, the great whole, is what we call Nature.”<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> It
is like what Aristotle (<i>vide</i> Vol. I. p. 241) says of
Xenophanes, that he gazed into the blue, <i>i.e.</i> into Being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
According to Hollbach all is movement, matter moves
itself: beer ferments, the soul is moved by its passions.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
“The manifold variety of natural phenomena, and their
incessant rise and disappearance, have their sole ground
in the variety of motions and of their material.” Through
different combinations and modifications, through a different
arrangement, another thing is originated. “Material substances
have either a tendency to combine with one another,
or else they are incapable of so combining. Upon this
are based by physical scientists the forces of attraction and
repulsion, sympathy and antipathy, affinity and relation;
and the moralists base thereon hatred and love, friendship
and enmity.” Spirit, the incorporeal, contradicts or opposes
itself to motion, to a change of the relations of a body in
space.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<h4><a id="c394">b. <span class="smcap">Robinet.</span></a></h4>

<p>Another work of importance is the still more “dangerous”
treatise, <i>De la Nature</i>, by Robinet. In it there reigns
quite a different and a deeper spirit; one is frequently
struck by the depth of earnestness which the writer displays.
He begins thus: “There is a God, <i>i.e.</i> a cause of
the phenomena of that Whole which we call Nature.
Who is God? We know not, and we are so constituted
that we can never know in what order of things we have
been placed. We cannot know God perfectly, because the
means of doing so will always be lacking to us. We too
might write over the doors of our temples the words
which were to be read upon the altar which the Areopagite
raised, ‘To the unknown God.’” The very same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
is said now-a-days: there can be no transition from the
finite to the infinite. “The order which reigns in the
universe is just as little the visible type of His wisdom, as
our weak mind is the image of His intelligence.” But
this First Cause, God, is according to Robinet a creative
God, He has brought Nature into existence; so that for
him the only possible knowledge is that of Nature. “There
is only One Cause. The eternal Cause, who so to speak
had sown (<i>engrainé</i>) events one in the other, in order
that they might without fail follow one upon another as
He chose, in the beginning set in motion the endless chain
of things. Through this permanent impression the Universe
goes on living, moving and perpetuating itself. From the
unity of cause there follows the unity of activity, for even
it does not appear as something to be more or less admitted.
By virtue of this single act all things come to pass. Since
man has made Nature his study, he has found no isolated
phenomenon, and no independent truth, because there are
not and cannot be such. The whole sustains itself through
the mutual correspondence of its parts.”<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The activity of
Nature is one, as God is One.</p>

<p>This activity, more particularly regarded, signifies that
germs unfold themselves in everything: everywhere there
are organic Beings which produce themselves; nothing is
isolated, everything is combined and connected and in
harmony. Robinet here goes through the plants, the
animals, and also the metals, the elements, air, fire, water,
&amp;c.; and seeks from them to demonstrate the existence of
the germ in whatever has life, and also how metals are
organized in themselves. “The example of the polypus is
convincing as to the animal nature (<i>animalité</i>) of the
smallest portions of organized matter; for the polypus is
a group of associated polypi, each of which is as much a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
true polypus as the first. It stands proved that from the
same point of view the living consists only of the living,
the animals of minute animals, every animal in particular
of minute animals of the same kind, a dog of dog-germs,
man of human germs.” In proof of this Robinet states in
a “Recapitulation” that “animal sperm swarms with
spermatic animalcules.” Since he then connects every
propagation properly so-called with the co-operation of both
sexes, he alleges that every individual is inwardly or
also in the external organs a hermaphrodite. Of the
minerals he says: “Are we not compelled to regard as
organic bodies all those in which we meet with an inward
structure such as this? It presupposes throughout a seed,
seed-granules, germs, of which they are the development.”
In the same way the air must have its germ, which does
not come to reality until it is nourished by water, fire, &amp;c.
“The air, as principle, is only the germ of the air; as it
impregnates or saturates itself in varying degrees with
water and fire, it will gradually pass through different
stages of growth: it will become first embryo, then perfect
air.”<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Robinet gives the name of germ to the simple form
in itself, the substantial form, the Notion. Although he
seeks to prove this too much from the sensuous side, he yet
proceeds from principles in themselves concrete, from the
form in itself.</p>

<p>He speaks also of the evil and good in the world. The
result of his observation is that good and evil balance
each other; this equilibrium constitutes the beauty of
the world. In order to refute the assertion that there is
more good than evil in the world, he says that everything
to which we reduce the good consists only in an enjoyment,
a pleasure, a satisfaction; but this must be preceded by a
want, a lack, a pain, the removal of which constitutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
satisfaction.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> This is not only a correct thought empirically,
but it also hints at the deeper idea that there is no activity
except through contradiction.</p>

<h3><a id="c397">3. <span class="smcap">Idea of a Concrete Universal Unity.</span></a></h3>

<p>The result of the French philosophy is that it insisted
on maintaining a general unity, not abstract, but concrete.
Thus Robinet now propounded the theory of a universal
organic life, and a uniform mode of origination; this concrete
system he called Nature, over which God was set,
but as the unknowable; all predicates which could be expressed
of Him contained something inapplicable. We
must admit that grand conceptions of concrete unity are to
be found here, as opposed to the abstract metaphysical
determinations of the understanding, <i>e.g.</i> the fruitfulness
of Nature. But, on the other hand, the point of most importance
with these philosophers is that what is to be
accepted as valid must have presence, and that man in
all knowledge must be himself the knower; for, as we
may see, those philosophers made war on all external
authority of state and church, and in particular on abstract
thought which has no present meaning in us. Two determinations
found in all philosophy are the concretion of the
Idea and the presence of the spirit in the same; my content
must at the same time be something concrete, present.
This concrete was termed Reason, and for it the more
noble of those men contended with the greatest enthusiasm
and warmth. Thought was raised like a standard among
the nations, liberty of conviction and of conscience in me.
They said to mankind, “In this sign thou shalt conquer,”
for they had before their eyes what had been done in the
name of the cross alone, what had been made a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
faith and law and religion—they saw how the sign of the
cross had been degraded. For in the sign of the cross
lying and deceit had been victorious, under this seal institutions
had become fossilized, and had sunk into all
manner of degradation, so that this sign came to be represented
as the epitome and root of all evil. Thus in another
form they completed the Reformation that Luther began.
This concrete had manifold forms; social instincts in the
practical sphere, laws of nature in the theoretical. There
is present the absolute impulse to find a compass immanent
in themselves, <i>i.e.</i> in the human mind. For the human
mind it is imperative to have a fixed point such as this, if,
indeed, it is to be within itself, if it is to be free in its own
world at least. But this striving after really present
vitality took forms which as by-paths were themselves one-sided.
In this striving after unity, which was, however,
concrete unity, the further varieties of the content likewise
lie.</p>

<p>On the theoretic side of their philosophy, therefore, the
French proceeded to materialism or naturalism, because
the requirements of the understanding, as abstract thought,
which from a firmly fixed principle allows the most
monstrous consequences to be drawn, drove them to set
up one principle as ultimate, and that a principle which
had at the same time to be present and to lie quite close
to experience. Hence they accept sensation and matter as
the only truth, to which must be reduced all thought, all
morality, as a mere modification of sensation. The
unities which the French propounded were in this way one-sided.</p>

<h4><a id="c398">a. <span class="smcap">Opposition of Sensation and Thought.</span></a></h4>

<p>To this one-sidedness belongs the opposition between
<i>sentir</i> and <i>penser</i>, or else, if you like, their identity, making
the latter only a result of the former; there is not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
any speculative reconciliation of this opposition in
God, such as we find in Spinoza and Malebranche. This
reduction of all thought to sensation, which in certain
respects took place with Locke, becomes a widely extended
theory. Robinet (<i>De la Nature</i>, T. I. P. IV.
chap. iii. pp. 257-259) lights also on this opposition, beyond
which he does not get, that mind and body are not
separate, but that the manner in which they are united is
inexplicable. The <i>Système de la Nature</i> (T. I. chap. x.
p. 177) is marked by an especially plain reduction of
thought to sensation. The leading thought is this: “Abstract
thoughts are only modes in which our inmost organ
views its own modifications. The words goodness, beauty,
order, intelligence, virtue, &amp;c., have no meaning for us
if we do not refer and apply them to objects which our
senses have shown to be capable of these qualities, or to
modes of being and acting which are known to us.”
Thus even psychology passed into materialism, as for instance
we may find in La Mettrie’s work <i>L’homme
Machine</i>: All thought and all conception have meaning
only if they are apprehended as material; matter alone
exists.</p>

<h4><a id="c399">b. <span class="smcap">Montesquieu.</span></a></h4>

<p>Other great writers have opposed to the above the feeling
in the breast, the instinct of self-preservation, benevolent
dispositions towards others, the impulse to fellowship,
which last Puffendorf also made the foundation of his system
of law (<i>supra</i>, p. 321). From this point of view much that
is excellent has been said. Thus Montesquieu, in his
charming book, <i>L’Esprit des Lois</i>, of which Voltaire said
it was an <i>esprit sur les lois</i>, regarded the nations from this
important point of view, that their constitution, their religion,
in short, everything that is to be found in a state,
constitutes a totality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<h4><a id="c400a">c. <span class="smcap">Helvetius.</span></a></h4>

<p>This reduction of thought to feeling in the case of
Helvetius takes the form that if in man as a moral
being a single principle is sought, this ought to be
called self-love, and he endeavoured to demonstrate by
ingenious analysis that whatever we term virtue, all
activity and law and right, has as its foundation nothing
but self-love or selfishness, and is resolvable thereinto.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
This principle is one-sided, although the “I myself” is
an essential moment. What I will, the noblest, the holiest,
is <i>my</i> aim; I must take part in it, I must agree to it, I
must approve of it. With all self-sacrifice there is always
conjoined some satisfaction, some finding of self; this
element of self, subjective liberty, must always be present.
If this is taken in a one-sided sense, there may be consequences
drawn from it which overthrow all that is sacred;
but it is found in equal degree in a morality as noble as
any possibly can be.</p>

<h4><a id="c400b">d. <span class="smcap">Rousseau.</span></a></h4>

<p>In connection with the practical side of things this particular
must also be noted, that when the feeling of right,
the concrete practical mind, and, speaking generally,
humanity and happiness were made the principle, this
principle, universally conceived, had certainly the form of
thought; but in the case of such concrete content derived
from our impulse or inward intuition, even though that content
were religious, the thought itself was not the content.
But now this further phase appeared, that pure thought was
set up as the principle and content, even if again there was
lacking to this content the true consciousness of its peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
form; for it was not recognized that this principle was
thought. We see it emerge in the sphere of will, of the
practical, of the just, and so apprehended that the innermost
principle of man, his unity with himself, is set forth
as fundamental and brought into consciousness, so that man
in himself acquired an infinite strength. It is this that
Rousseau from one point of view said about the state. He
investigated its absolute justification, and inquired as to
its foundation. The right of ruling and associating, of the
relation of order, of governing and being governed, he
apprehends from his own point of view, so that it is made
to rest historically on power, compulsion, conquest, private
property, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau makes free-will the principle of this justification,
and without reference to the positive right of states
he made answer to the above question (chap. iv. p. 12), that
man has free-will, because “liberty is the distinguishing
feature of man. To renounce his liberty signifies to renounce
his manhood. Not to be free is therefore a renunciation
of a man’s rights as a human being, and even of his
duties.” The slave has neither rights nor duties. Rousseau
therefore says (chap. vi. p. 21): “The fundamental task
is to find a form of association which will shield and protect
with the power of the whole commonwealth combined the
person and property of every one of its members, and in
which each individual, while joining this association, obeys
himself only, and thus remains as free as before. The solution
is given by the Social Contract;” this is the association
of which each is a member by his own will. These principles,
thus abstractly stated, we must allow to be correct, yet the
ambiguity in them soon begins to be felt. Man is free, this
is certainly the substantial nature of man; and not only is
this liberty not relinquished in the state, but it is actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
in the state that it is first realized. The freedom of nature,
the gift of freedom, is not anything real; for the state is
the first realization of freedom.</p>

<p>The misunderstanding as to the universal will proceeds
from this, that the Notion of freedom must not be taken in
the sense of the arbitrary caprice of an individual, but in
the sense of the rational will, of the will in and for itself.
The universal will is not to be looked on as compounded of
definitively individual wills, so that these remain absolute;
otherwise the saying would be correct: “Where the
minority must obey the majority, there is no freedom.”
The universal will must really be the rational will, even if
we are not conscious of the fact; the state is therefore not
an association which is decreed by the arbitrary will of individuals.
The wrong apprehension of these principles does
not concern us. What does concern us is this, that thereby
there should come into consciousness as content the sense
that man has liberty in his spirit as the altogether absolute,
that free-will is the Notion of man. Freedom is just
thought itself; he who casts thought aside and speaks of
freedom knows not what he is talking of. The unity of
thought with itself is freedom, the free will. Thought, as
volition merely, is the impulse to abrogate one’s subjectivity,
the relation to present existence, the realizing of oneself,
since in that I am endeavouring to place myself as existent
on an equality with myself as thinking. It is only as having
the power of thinking that the will is free. The principle
of freedom emerged in Rousseau, and gave to man,
who apprehends himself as infinite, this infinite strength.
This furnishes the transition to the Kantian philosophy,
which, theoretically considered, made this principle its
foundation; knowledge aimed at freedom, and at a concrete
content which it possesses in consciousness.</p>

<h2><a id="c403">D. <span class="smcap">The German Illumination.</span></a></h2>

<p>The Germans were at this time quietly drifting along in
their Leibnitzo-Wolffian philosophy, in its definitions,
axioms and proofs. Then they were gradually breathed
upon by the spirit of foreign lands, they made acquaintance
with all the developments which there came to pass, and
took very kindly to the empiricism of Locke; on the other
hand they at the same time laid aside metaphysical investigations,
turned their attention to the question of how truths
can be grasped by the healthy human understanding, and
plunged into the <i>Aufklärung</i> and into the consideration of
the utility of all things—a point of view which they adopted
from the French. Utility as the essence of existent things
signifies that they are determined as not being in themselves,
but for another: this is a necessary moment, but
not the only one. The German <i>Aufklärung</i> warred against
ideas, with the principle of utility as its weapon. Philosophic
investigations on this subject had degenerated into
a feeble popular treatment of it which was incapable of
going deeper; they displayed a rigid pedantry and an
earnestness of the understanding, but were unspiritual.
The Germans are busy bees who do justice to all nations,
they are old-clothesmen for whom anything is good
enough, and who carry on their haggling with everyone.
Picked up as it was from foreign nations, all this had
lost the wit and life, the energy and originality which with
the French had made the content to be lost sight of in the
form. The Germans, who honestly sift a matter to its root,
and who would put rational arguments in the place of wit
and vivacity, since wit and vivacity really prove nothing,
in this way reached a content which was utterly empty, so
much so that nothing could be more wearisome than this
profound mode of treatment; such was the case with Eberhard,
Tetens, and those like them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Others, like Nicolai, Sulzer and their fellows, were excellent
in their speculations on questions of taste and the
liberal sciences; for literature and art were also to flourish
among the Germans. But with all this they only arrived
at a most trivial treatment of æsthetics—Lessing<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> called it
shallow chatter. As a matter of fact, indeed, the poems
of Gellert, Weisse and Lessing sank almost, if not quite
as much into the same poetic feebleness. Moreover,
previous to the philosophy of Kant, the general principle
was really the theory of happiness, which we have already
met with in the philosophy of the Cyrenaics (Vol. I. p. 477),
and the point of view of pleasant or unpleasant sensations
held good among the philosophers of that time as an ultimate
and essential determination. Of this manner of
philosophizing I will quote an example which Nicolai gives
in the account of a conversation which he had with Mendelssohn:
what is in question is the pleasure in tragic
subjects which is held to be awakened even by means of
the unpleasant emotions depicted in a tragedy:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pc"><span class="smcap">Herr Moses.</span></p>

<p>“The power of having an inclination for perfections and of
shunning imperfections is a reality.” Therefore the exercise
of this power brings a pleasure with it, which, however, is
in nature comparatively less than the displeasure which
arises from the contemplation of the object.</p>

<p class="pc"><span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<p>Yet even then, when the violence of passion causes us
unpleasant sensations, the movement (what else is this
movement than the power of loving perfections, &amp;c.?)
which it brings with it has still delights for us. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
strength of the movement which we enjoy, even in spite
of the painful sensations which oppose what is pleasant in
the passion, and in a short time obtain the victory.</p>

<p class="pc"><span class="smcap">Herr Moses.</span></p>

<p>In a stage play, on the contrary, as the imperfect object
is absent, pleasure must gain the upper hand and eclipse
the small degree of displeasure.</p>

<p class="pc"><span class="smcap">I.</span></p>

<p>A passion therefore which is not followed by these
results must be altogether pleasant. Of this sort are the
imitations of the passions which the tragedy affords.”<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

</div>

<p>With such vapid and meaningless drivel they rambled
on. In addition to these, the eternity of punishment in
hell, the salvation of the heathen, the difference between
uprightness and godliness, were philosophic matters on
which much labour was expended among the Germans,
while the French troubled themselves little about them.
Finite determinations were made to hold good against the
infinite; against the Trinity it was asserted that One
cannot be Three; against original sin, that each must
bear his own guilt, must have done his own deeds of
himself, and must answer for them; in the same way
against redemption, that another cannot take upon himself
punishment that is due; against forgiveness of sin, that
what is done cannot be rendered undone; to sum up
generally, the incommensurability of the human nature
with the divine. On the one side we see healthy human
understanding, experience, facts of consciousness, but on
the other side there was still in vogue the Wolffian metaphysics
of the dry, dead understanding; thus we see
Mendelssohn take his stand by the healthy human understanding,
and make it his rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Some movement was brought into this authority, which
had settled into perfect peace and security and let no
dreams of other matters cross its path, by the chance
dispute of Mendelssohn with Jacobi, first as to whether
Lessing had been a disciple of Spinoza, and then regarding
the doctrines of Spinoza himself. On this occasion it
came to light how much Spinoza was really forgotten, and
in what horror Spinozism was held. But while Jacobi in
this way once more unexpectedly brought to remembrance
in connection with Spinozism a quite different content of
philosophy, faith, <i>i.e.</i> the simply immediate certainty of
external, finite things, as well as of the divine (which
faith in the divine he called reason) was certainly placed
by him, as an independent thinker, in opposition to
mediating knowledge, which he apprehended as mere
understanding. This continued until Kant gave a new
impulse in Germany to philosophy, which had died out in
the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>As far as the transition to modern German philosophy is
concerned, it is from Hume and Rousseau, as we have
said (pp. 369, 374, 402), that it took its start. Descartes
opposes extension to thought, as what is simply one with
itself. He is charged with dualism, but, like Spinoza and
Leibnitz, he did away with the independence of the two
sides, and made supreme their unity, God. But, as this
unity, God is first of all only the Third; and He is further
determined in such a way that no determination pertains
to Him. Wolff’s understanding of the finite, his school
metaphysics generally, his science of the understanding,
and his divergence into the observation of nature, after it
has grown strong in its conformity with law and in its
finite knowledge, turns against the infinite and the concrete
determinations of religion, and comes to a standstill with
abstractions in his <i>theologia naturalis</i>; for the determinate
is his domain. But from this time an utterly different
point of view is introduced. The infinite is transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
into abstraction or incomprehensibility. This is an incomprehensible
position to adopt. Nowadays it is looked
on as most pious, most justifiable. But as we see the
third, the unity of differences, defined as something
which cannot be thought or known, this unity is not one
of thought, for it is above all thought, and God is not
simply thought. Nevertheless this unity is defined as
the absolutely concrete, <i>i.e.</i> as the unity of thought and
Being. Now we have come so far that this unity is a
unity simply in thought, and pertaining to consciousness,
so that the objectivity of thought—reason—comes forth as
One and All. This is dimly conceived by the French.
Whether the highest Being, this Being divested of all
determination, is elevated above nature, or whether nature
or matter is the highest unity, there is always present the
establishing of something concrete, which at the same time
belongs to thought. Since the liberty of man has been
set up as an absolutely ultimate principle, thought itself
has been set up as a principle. The principle of liberty is
not only in thought but the root of thought; this principle
of liberty is also something in itself concrete, at least in
principle it is implicitly concrete. Thus far have general
culture and philosophic culture advanced. Since what is
knowable has now been placed entirely within the sphere
of consciousness, and since the liberty of the spirit has
been apprehended as absolute, this may be understood to
mean that knowledge has entered altogether into the realm
of the finite. The standpoint of the finite was at the same
time taken as ultimate, and God as a Beyond outside consciousness;
duties, rights, knowledge of nature, are finite.
Man has thereby formed for himself a kingdom of truth,
from which God is excluded; it is the kingdom of finite
truth. The form of finitude may here be termed the
subjective form; liberty, self-consciousness [Ichheit] of
the mind, known as the absolute, is essentially subjective—in
fact it is the subjectivity of thought. The more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
human reason has grasped itself in itself, the more has it
come down from God and the more has it increased the
field of the finite. Reason is One and All, which is at the
same time the totality of the finite; reason under these
conditions is finite knowledge and knowledge of the finite.
The question is, since it is this concrete that is established
(and not metaphysical abstractions), how it constitutes
itself in itself; and then, how it returns to objectivity, or
abrogates its subjectivity, <i>i.e.</i> how by means of thought
God is to be again brought about, who at an earlier time
and at the beginning of this period was recognized as
alone the true. This is what we have to consider in the
last period, in dealing with Kant, Fichte, and Schelling.</p>

<p class="pc1 large"><span class="smcap">Recent German Philosophy</span></p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the philosophy of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling, the
revolution to which in Germany mind has in these latter
days advanced, was formally thought out and expressed;
the sequence of these philosophies shows the course which
thought has taken. In this great epoch of the world’s
history, whose inmost essence is laid hold of in the philosophy
of history, two nations only have played a part, the
German and the French, and this in spite of their absolute
opposition, or rather because they are so opposite. The
other nations have taken no real inward part in the same,
although politically they have indeed so done, both through
their governments and their people. In Germany this
principle has burst forth as thought, spirit, Notion; in
France, in the form of actuality. In Germany, what
there is of actuality comes to us as a force of external circumstances,
and as a reaction against the same. The task of
modern German philosophy is, however, summed up in
taking as its object the unity of thought and Being,
which is the fundamental idea of philosophy generally,
and comprehending it, that is, in laying hold of the inmost
significance of necessity, the Notion (<i>supra</i>, p. 360). The
philosophy of Kant sets forth, in the first place, the formal
aspect of the task, but it has the abstract absoluteness of
reason in self-consciousness as its sole result, and, in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
respect, it carried with it a certain character of shallowness
and want of vigour, in which an attitude of criticism and
negativity is retained, and which, as far as any positive
element is concerned, adheres to the facts of consciousness
and to mere conjecture, while it renounces thought and
returns to feeling. On the other hand, however, there
sprang from this the philosophy of Fichte, which speculatively
grasps the essence of self-consciousness as concrete
egoism, but which does not reach beyond this subjective
form pertaining to the absolute. From it again comes the
philosophy of Schelling, which subsequently rejects Fichte’s
teaching and sets forth the Idea of the Absolute, the truth
in and for itself.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c410">A. <span class="smcap">Jacobi.</span></a></h2>

<p>In connection with Kant we must here begin by speaking
of Jacobi, whose philosophy is contemporaneous with
that of Kant; in both of these the advance beyond the preceding
period is very evident. The result in the two cases
is much the same, although both the starting point and the
method of progression are somewhat different. In Jacobi’s
case the stimulus was given mainly by French philosophy,
with which he was very conversant, and also by German
metaphysics, while Kant began rather from the English
side, that is, from the scepticism of Hume. Jacobi, in that
negative attitude which he preserved as well as Kant, kept
before him the objective aspect of the method of knowledge,
and specially considered it, for he declared knowledge
to be in its content incapable of recognizing the
Absolute: the truth must be concrete, present, but not
finite. Kant does not consider the content, but took the
view of knowledge being subjective; and for this reason he
declared it to be incapable of recognizing absolute existence.
To Kant knowledge is thus a knowledge of phenomena
only, not because the categories are merely limited
and finite, but because they are subjective. To Jacobi, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the other hand, the chief point is that the categories are not
merely subjective, but that they themselves are conditioned.
This is an essential difference between the two points of
view, even if they both arrive at the same result.</p>

<p>Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, born at Düsseldorf in 1743,
held office first in the Duchy of Berg, and then in Bavaria.
He studied in Geneva and Paris, associating in the former
place with Bonnet and in the latter with Diderot. Jacobi
was a man of the highest character and culture. He was long
occupied with State affairs, and in Düsseldorf he held a public
office which was connected with the administration of the
finance department in the State. At the time of the French
Revolution he was obliged to retire. As a Bavarian official
he went to Munich, there became President of the Academy
of Sciences in 1804, which office he, however, resigned in
1812; for in the Napoleonic period Protestants were
decried as demagogues. He lived at Munich till the end
of his life, and died at the same place on the 10th of March,
1819.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1785, Jacobi published Letters on Spinoza,
which were written in 1783, on the occasion of the dispute
with Mendelssohn above-mentioned (p. 406); for in none
of his writings did Jacobi develop his philosophy systematically,
he set it forth in letters only. When Mendelssohn
wished to write a life of Lessing, Jacobi sent to ask him if
he knew that “Lessing was a Spinozist” (Jacobi’s Werke,
Vol. IV. Sec. 1, pp. 39, 40). Mendelssohn was displeased
at this, and it was the occasion of the correspondence. In
the course of the dispute it was made evident that those
who held themselves to be professed philosophers and
possessed of a monopoly of Lessing’s friendship, such as
Nicolai, Mendelssohn, &amp;c., knew nothing about Spinozism;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
not only was there manifested in them the superficial
character of their philosophic insight, but ignorance as well;
with Mendelssohn, for instance, this was shown respecting
even the outward history of the Spinozistic philosophy,
and much more regarding the inward (Jacobi’s Werke,
Vol. IV. Sec. 1, p. 91). That Jacobi asserted Lessing to
be a Spinozist, and gave a high place to the French—this
serious statement came to these good men as a thunderbolt
from the blue. They—the self-satisfied, self-possessed,
superior persons—were quite surprised that he also made
pretensions to knowledge, and of such a “dead dog” as
Spinoza (<i>ibidem</i>, p. 68). Explanations followed upon this,
in which Jacobi further developed his philosophic views.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn is directly opposed to Jacobi, for Mendelssohn
took his stand on cognition, placed true existence
immediately in thought and conception, and maintained:
“What I cannot think as true does not trouble me as doubt.
A question which I do not understand, I cannot answer,
it is for me as good as no question at all.”<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> He continued
to argue on these same lines. His proof of the existence of
God thus carries with it this necessity of thought, viz. that
actuality must plainly be in thought, and a thinker must be
presupposed, or the possibility of the actual is in the
thinker. “What no thinking Being conceives as possible
is not possible, and what is thought by no thinking creature
as actual cannot be actual in fact. If we take away from
anything whatsoever the conception formed by a thinking
Being that that thing is possible or actual, the thing itself
is done away with.” The Notion of the thing is thus to
man the essence of the same. “No finite Being can think
the actuality of a thing in its perfection as actual, and still
less can he perceive the possibility and actuality of all present
things. There must thus be a thinking Being or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
understanding which in the most perfect way thinks the
content of all possibilities as possible, and the content of all
actualities as actual; <i>i.e.</i> there must be an infinite understanding,
and this is God.”<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Here on the one hand we see a
unity of thought and Being, on the other the absolute unity
as infinite understanding—the former is the self-consciousness
which is apprehended as finite merely. Actuality,
Being, has its possibility in thought, or its possibility is
thought; it is not a process from possibility to actuality,
for the possibility remains at home in the actuality.</p>

<p>Jacobi maintains against these demands of thought—and
this in one view is the chief thought in his philosophy—that
every method of their demonstration leads to fatalism,
atheism, and Spinozism,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and presents God as derived and
founded upon something else; for comprehending Him
signifies demonstrating His dependence. Jacobi thus
asserts that mediate knowledge consists in giving a cause
of something which has in its turn a finite effect, and so on;
so that a knowledge such as this can all through relate to
the finite only.</p>

<p>Jacobi further states upon this subject, in the first place,
that “Reason”—later on when he distinguished reason and
understanding (of which more hereafter<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>), he altered it to
understanding<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>—“can never bring to light more than the
conditions of what is conditioned, natural laws and
mechanism. We comprehend a thing when we can
deduce it from its proximate causes,” and not from
the remoter causes; the most remote and quite universal
cause is always God. “Or” we know the thing if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
we “perceive its immediate conditions as they come in
due succession. Thus, for instance, we comprehend a circle
when we can clearly represent to ourselves the mechanism
of its origination or its physical conditions; we know the
syllogistic formulæ when we have actually come to know the
laws to which the human understanding is subject in judgment
and conclusion, its physical nature and its mechanism.
For this reason we have no conceptions of qualities as such,
but only intuitions. Even of our present existence we have
a feeling only, but no conceptions. Genuine conceptions we
have merely of figure, number, position, movement and the
forms of thought; qualities are known and understood, if
they are traced back to these and objectively annulled.”
This is undoubtedly really finite knowledge, which is to
give the determinate conditions of anything determinate,
to demonstrate it as resulting from another cause, in such a
way that each condition is again conditioned and finite.
Jacobi continues: “The business of reason is really progressive
union and connection, and its speculative business
is union and connection in accordance with the known
laws of necessity, <i>i.e.</i> of identity. Everything that reason
can bring forth by means of analysis, combination, judgment,
conclusion, and re-conception, consists in nothing but
things of nature” (<i>i.e.</i> finite things), “and reason itself, as a
limited existence, belongs to these things. But the whole
of nature, the sum of all conditioned existence, cannot
reveal more to the investigating understanding than what
is contained in it, namely, manifold existence, changes, a
succession of forms” (the conditioned), “and not an actual
beginning” (of the world), “nor a real principle of any
objective existence.”<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>But Jacobi in the second place here accepts reason in a
wider sense and says: “If we understand by reason the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
principle of knowledge generally, it is the mind from
which the whole living nature of man is constituted;
through it man arises; he is a form which it has adopted.”
With this Jacobi’s view of the attempt to know the unconditioned
is connected. “I take the whole human being,
and find that his consciousness is composed of two original
conceptions, the conceptions of the conditioned and the unconditioned.
Both are inseparably bound up with one another,
and yet in such a way that the conception of the conditioned
presupposes the conception of the unconditioned, and can
be given in this alone. We are just as certain of its
existence as we are of our own conditioned existence, or
even more so. Since our conditioned existence rests on an
infinitude of mediations, there is opened up to our investigation
a vast field which, for the sake of our preservation
even, we are forced to work upon.” It would, however, be
quite another thing to wish to know the unconditioned
apart from this practical end. However Jacobi here
remarks, “To try to discover the conditions of the unconditioned,
to find a possibility for absolute necessity, and to
construct this last in order to be able to comprehend it, is
what we undertake when we endeavour to make nature
an existence comprehensible to us, <i>i.e.</i> a merely natural
existence, and to bring the mechanism of the principle of
mechanism into the light of day. For if everything which
can be said to arise and be present in a way comprehensible
to us, must arise and be present in a conditioned way,
we remain, so long as we continue to comprehend, in a
chain of conditioned conditions. Where this chain breaks
off, we cease to comprehend, and there the connection which
we call nature likewise ceases. The conception of the possibility
of the outward existence of nature would thus be the
conception of an absolute beginning or origin of nature; it
would be the conception of the unconditioned itself in so far
as it is a conditioning of nature not naturally connected,
<i>i.e.</i> a conditioning of nature unconnected and unconditioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
for us. Now should a conception of what is thus unconditioned
and unconnected, and consequently supernatural, be
possible, the unconditioned must cease to be unconditioned,
it must itself receive conditions; and absolute necessity
must commence to be possibility in order that it may allow
itself to be constructed.”<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> This is contradictory.</p>

<p>Jacobi then passes on from this point to the second of his
main propositions, “The unconditioned is called the supernatural.
Now since everything which lies outside the connection
of what is conditioned, of what is naturally mediated,
also lies outside the sphere of our clear and certain
knowledge, and cannot be understood through conceptions,
the supernatural cannot be accepted in any other way by
us than that in which it is given to us—namely as a fact.
It is! This supernatural, this essence of all essence, all
tongues join in proclaiming to be God.”<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> God as the
universal, the true, is here taken in the sense of a spiritual
generally, in the sense of power, wisdom, &amp;c. That God
is, however, is to Jacobi not absolutely true; for to knowledge
pertains His objective absolute existence, but He cannot
be said to be known. It is thus merely a fact of my
consciousness that God exists independently apart from my
consciousness; this, however, is itself maintained through
my consciousness; the subjective attitude of thought is thus
to Jacobi the element of most importance. The consciousness
of God, which is in our consciousness, is, however, of
such a nature that along with the thought of God we have
immediately associated the fact that He is. The existence of
the supernatural and supersensuous, to which the thought
of man regarding the natural and finite passes on, is just as
certain to Jacobi as he is himself. This certainty is identical
with his self-consciousness; as certainly as I am, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
certainly is God (Jacobi’s Werke, Vol. III. p. 35). Since
he thus passes back into self-consciousness, the unconditioned
is only for us in an immediate way; this immediate
knowledge Jacobi calls Faith, inward revelation (Werke,
Vol. II. pp. 3, 4); to this appeal can be made in man. God,
the absolute, the unconditioned, cannot, according to Jacobi,
be proved. For proof, comprehension, means to discover
conditions for something, to derive it from conditions; but
a derived absolute, God, &amp;c., would thus not be absolute at
all, would not be unconditioned, would not be God (Jacobi’s
Werke, Vol. III. p. 7). This immediate knowledge of God
is then the point which is maintained in the philosophy of
Jacobi. The faith of Kant and of Jacobi are, however, different.
To Kant it is a postulate of reason, it is the demand
for the solution of the contradiction between the world and
goodness; to Jacobi it is represented on its own account as
immediate knowledge.</p>

<p>Everything which has been written upon God since
Jacobi’s time, by philosophers such as Fries and by theologians,
rests on this conception of immediate intellectual
knowledge, and men even call this revelation, though in
another sense than the revelation of theology. Revelation
as immediate knowledge is in ourselves, while the Church
holds revelation to be something imparted from without.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
In the theological sense, faith is faith in something which is
given to us through teaching. It is a sort of deception
when faith and revelation are spoken of and represented as if
faith and revelation in the theological sense were here in question;
for the sense in which they are used, and which may be
termed philosophic, is quite a different one, however pious
an air may be assumed in using the terms. This is Jacobi’s
standpoint, and whatever is by philosophers and theologians
said against it, this teaching is eagerly accepted and disseminated.
And nowhere is there anything to be found but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
reflections originating from Jacobi, whereby immediate
knowledge is opposed to philosophic knowledge and to
reason; and people speak of reason, philosophy, &amp;c.,
as a blind man speaks of colours. It is, indeed, allowed
that a man cannot make shoes unless he is a shoemaker,
even although he have the measure and foot, and also the
hands. But when Philosophy is concerned, immediate
knowledge signifies that every man as he walks and stands
is a philosopher, that he can dogmatize as he chooses, and
that he is completely acquainted with Philosophy.</p>

<p>By reason, however, mediate knowledge merely is on the
one hand understood, and on the other the intellectual perception
which speaks of facts (<i>supra</i>, pp. 413-415). In this
respect it is true that reason is the knowledge and revelation
of absolute truth, since the understanding is the revelation
of the finite (Jacobi’s Werke, Vol. II. pp. 8-14, 101). “We
maintained that two different powers of perception in man
have to be accepted: a power of perception through visible
and tangible and consequently corporeal organs of perception,
and another kind of power, viz. through an invisible
organ which in no way represents itself to the outward
senses, and whose existence is made known to us through
feeling alone. This organ, a spiritual eye for spiritual objects,
has been called by men—generally speaking—reason. He
whom the pure feelings of the beautiful and good, of admiration
and love, of respect and awe, do not convince that in
and with these feelings he perceives something to be present
which is independent of them, and which is unattainable
by the outward senses or by an understanding directed
upon their perceptions alone—such an one cannot be argued
with” (Jacobi’s Werke, Vol. II. pp. 74, 76). But by faith
Jacobi likewise understands all that has immediacy of Being
for me: “Through faith we know that we have a body, we
become aware of other actual things, and that indeed with
the same certainty with which we are aware of ourselves.
We obtain all conceptions through the qualities which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
we receive and accept, and there is no other way of
attaining real knowledge; for reason, when it begets
objects, begets phantoms of the brain. Thus we have a
revelation of nature.”<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Hence the expression faith, which
had a deep significance in religion, is made use of for
different contents of every kind; this in our own time is the
point of view most commonly adopted.</p>

<p>Jacobi here brings faith into opposition with thought.
Let us compare the two, and discover whether they are
separated by so great a chasm as those who thus oppose
them think. On the one hand absolute existence is to
faith immediate; believing consciousness feels itself penetrated
by this as by its essence: that existence is its life,
believing consciousness asserts itself to be in direct unity
with it. Thought thinks the absolute existence; such
existence is to it absolute thought, absolute understanding,
pure thought; but that signifies that it is likewise immediate
itself. On the other hand to faith the immediacy of absolute
existence has also the significance of a Being: it
<i>is</i>, and is another than ‘I.’ And the same is true of the
thinker; to him it is absolute Being, actual in itself, and
different from self-consciousness or thought as finite understanding,
to use the common term. Now what is the reason
that faith and thought do not understand one another, and
each recognize itself in the other? In the first place faith
has no consciousness of being a thought, inasmuch as it
asserts absolute consciousness to be identical with it as
self-consciousness, and has direct inward knowledge of the
same. But it expresses this simple unity; in its consciousness
it is only immediacy so to speak in the signification
of Being, a unity of its unconscious substance. In the
second place Being-for-self is contained in thought; to
this faith opposes the immediacy of Being. Thought, on
the contrary, has the immediate as absolute potentiality, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
absolutely a thing of thought: and the immediacy belonging
to this thing of thought is without the determination
of Being, of life. On the heights of this abstraction the
two stand opposed to each other, as the <i>Aufklärung</i> which
asserts absolute existence to be a Beyond of self-consciousness,
and as the materialism which makes it so to speak
present matter (<i>supra</i>, pp. 382, 383). In the one case it is
in faith and thought as positive existence or thought, and in
the other it is the negative of self-consciousness, which is
thus either only determined as negative, as a Beyond, or
likewise as existent for self-consciousness. Hence faith
and thought are both of them knowledge. We call universal
knowledge thought, particular knowledge we call
sensuous perception; and we term the introduction of
external determinations understanding. The universal
element in man is thought, but to it likewise appertains
religious feeling for instance; the animal does not possess
it, for it has no human feeling; and in so far as this feeling
is religious, it is the feeling of a thinker, and what determines
this feeling is not the determination of natural
desire, &amp;c., but a universal determination. Thus God,
even though He is only felt and believed in, is yet the
universal taken quite abstractly—even in His personality
He is the absolutely universal personality.</p>

<p>As thought and faith are thus one, the same is true of
the antithesis between mediated and immediate knowledge.
We must, it is true, keep before our eyes the fact
that what is revealed in immediate knowledge is the
universal. But abstract immediate knowledge is natural,
sensuous knowledge; the immediate man in his natural
condition, in his desires, does not know this universal.
Children, the Esquimaux, &amp;c., know nothing of God; or
what the natural man knows of Him is not a real knowledge
of Him. Thus the intuitive knowledge of the
Egyptians told them that God was an ox or a cat, and the
Indians still possess similar sorts of knowledge. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
other hand when man has come so far as to know God as
merely an object of the mind, <i>i.e.</i> as spiritual, it is easy to
perceive that this knowledge which is asserted to be immediate
is really a result mediated through instruction,
through a long continued culture. It is only by means of
being elevated above nature that man arrives at a consciousness
of what is higher, and at a knowledge of the
universal; there indeed his knowledge is immediate, but
he has only arrived at this through mediation. I think,
and thus I know the universal immediately, but this very
thought is just process in itself, movement and life. All
life is process within itself, is mediated, and this is all the
more true of spiritual life; for it is the passing from one
to the other, that is, from the merely natural and sensuous
to the spiritual. It thus indicates a deficiency in the most
simple reflection not to know that the universal is not in
immediate knowledge, but is a result of the culture, the
education, and the self-revelation of the human race. If
immediate knowledge is to be allowed, everyone will be
responsible merely to himself: this man knows this,
another that, and consequently everything is justified and
approved, however contrary to right and religion. This
opposition between immediacy and mediacy is thus a very
barren and quite empty determination; it is a platitude of
the extremest type to consider anything like this to be a
true opposition; it proceeds from a most wooden understanding,
which thinks that an immediacy can be something
on its own account, without a mediation within itself. If
Philosophy were to result in this it would be a poor affair;
these determinations are merely forms, none of which has
intrinsic truth. The form into which Philosophy has in
Jacobi’s case finally fallen, which is that immediacy is
grasped as absolute, manifests a lack of all critical faculty,
of all logic. The Kantian philosophy is critical philosophy,
but from it the fact has been omitted that we cannot constitute
the infinite with finite categories—and immediacy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
such an one. When we regard this opposition more
closely all knowledge may be termed immediate, but all
immediate knowledge is likewise mediated in itself. This
we know within our consciousness, and we may see it in the
most general phenomena. I know, for example, of America
immediately, and yet this knowledge is very much mediated.
If I stand in America and see its soil, I must first of all
have journeyed to it, Columbus must first have discovered
it, ships must have been built, &amp;c.; all these discoveries and
inventions pertain to it. That which we now know immediately
is consequently a result of infinitely many mediations.
Likewise when I see a right-angled triangle I know that
the squares of the two sides are equal to the square of
the hypotenuse: I know this immediately, and yet I have
merely learned it and am convinced of it through the mediation
of proof. Immediate knowledge is thus everywhere
mediated, and Philosophy does nothing but bring this to
consciousness—demonstrating the mediation which in point
of fact is already present there, <i>e.g.</i> in religion, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Jacobi, inasmuch as it says: “Thought
cannot proceed further than to the feeling of God,” has
been accepted <i>utiliter</i>; it was more easily arrived at than
in the case of Kant. Knowledge, however, is something
very different from what Jacobi calls such; against finite
knowledge his arguments are quite correct. Immediate
knowledge is not knowledge, comprehension, for that implies
that the content is determined in itself, <i>i.e.</i> is grasped
as concrete. But in immediate knowledge it is the case
that the only fact known of God is that He exists. For
should there be determinations respecting God, they must,
according to Jacobi, be grasped as a finite, and the knowledge
of them would again merely be a progression from
finite to finite. There thus remains only the indeterminate
conception of God, an “Above me,” an indeterminate
Beyond. This gives accordingly the same result as does
the <i>Aufklärung</i>, viz. that the highest reality is ultimate:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
we find the same in French philosophy and in Kant—only
here we still have the opinion that this emptiness is the
highest philosophy possible. But if each standpoint has an
aspect wherein it is justified, there always rests in the proposition
that the human mind knows God immediately, the
important consideration that we have here a recognition of
the freedom of the human spirit: in it we have the source
of the knowledge of God, and all externality of authority is
thus abrogated in this principle. The principle is hereby
gained, but only the principle of freedom of spirit; and the
greatness of our time rests in the fact that freedom, the peculiar
possession of mind whereby it is at home with itself in
itself, is recognized, and that mind has this consciousness
within itself. This however is merely abstract, for the
next step is that the principle of freedom is again purified
and comes to its true objectivity, so that not everything
which strikes me or springs up within me must, because
it is manifested in me, hold good as true. It is only
through thought, which casts off the particular and accidental,
that the principle receives this objectivity which is
independent of mere subjectivity and in and for itself—though
in such a way that the freedom of mind still
remains respected. One’s own spirit must bear witness to
spirit that God is Spirit; the content must be true. But
this does not give authenticity to itself by its being
revealed with certainty to me. This is the standpoint,
and we have thus seen its deficiency and the greatness of
the principle which is involved in it.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c423">B. <span class="smcap">Kant.</span></a></h2>

<p>The philosophy of Kant, which we have now more particularly
to consider, made its appearance at the same time
as the above. While Descartes asserted certainty to be the
unity of thought and Being, we now have the consciousness
of thought in its subjectivity, <i>i.e.</i> in the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
as determinateness in contrast with objectivity, and then as
finitude and progression in finite determinations. Abstract
thought as personal conviction is that which is maintained
as certain; its contents are experience, but the methods
adopted by experience are once more formal thought and
argument. Kant turns back to the standpoint of Socrates;
we see in him the freedom of the subject as we saw it with
the Stoics, but the task in respect of content is now placed
on a higher level. An endless aiming at the concrete is
required for thought, a filling up in accordance with the
rule which completion prescribes, which signifies that the
content is itself the Idea as the unity of the Notion and
reality. With Jacobi thought, demonstration, does not in
the first place reach beyond the finite and conditioned, and
in the second place, even when God is likewise the metaphysical
object, the demonstration is really the making Him
conditioned and finite; in the third place the unconditioned,
what is then immediately certain, only exists in faith, a
subjectively fixed point of view but an unknowable one,
that is to say an undetermined, indeterminable, and consequently
an unfruitful one. The standpoint of the philosophy
of Kant, on the contrary, is in the first place to be
found in the fact that thought has through its reasoning
got so far as to grasp itself not as contingent but rather as
in itself the absolute ultimate. In the finite, in connection
with the finite, an absolute standpoint is raised which acts
as a connecting bond; it binds together the finite and leads
up to the infinite. Thought grasped itself as all in all, as
absolute in judgment; for it nothing external is authoritative,
since all authority can receive validity only through
thought. This thought, determining itself within itself
and concrete, is, however, in the second place, grasped as
subjective, and this aspect of subjectivity is the form which
from Jacobi’s point of view is predominant; the fact that
thought is concrete Jacobi has on the other hand for the
most part set aside. Both standpoints remain philosophies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
of subjectivity; since thought is subjective, the capacity of
knowing the absolute is denied to it. To Kant God cannot
on the one hand be found in experience; He can neither be
found in outward experience—as Lalande discovered when
he swept the whole heavens and found no God—nor can He
be discovered within; though no doubt mystics and enthusiasts
can experience many things in themselves, and amongst
these God, <i>i.e.</i> the Infinite. On the other hand Kant argues
to prove the existence of God, who is to him an hypothesis
necessary for the explanation of things, a postulate of practical
reason. But in this connection another French astronomer
made the following reply to the Emperor Napoleon:
“<i>Je n’ai pas eu besoin de cette hypothèse.</i>” According to this
the truth underlying the Kantian philosophy is the recognition
of freedom. Even Rousseau represented the absolute
to be found in freedom; Kant has the same principle, but
taken rather from the theoretic side. The French regard
it from the side of will, which is represented in their proverb:
“<i>Il a la tête près du bonnet.</i>” France possesses the sense of
actuality, of promptitude; because in that country conception
passes more immediately into action, men have there
applied themselves more practically to the affairs of actuality.
But however much freedom may be in itself concrete, it was
as undeveloped and in its abstraction that it was there applied
to actuality; and to make abstractions hold good in actuality
means to destroy actuality. The fanaticism which characterized
the freedom which was put into the hands of the
people was frightful. In Germany the same principle
asserted the rights of consciousness on its own account, but
it has been worked out in a merely theoretic way. We
have commotions of every kind within us and around us,
but through them all the German head quietly keeps its
nightcap on and silently carries on its operations beneath it.</p>

<p>Immanuel Kant was born at Königsberg in 1724, and
there studied theology to begin with; in the year 1755 he
entered upon his work as an academic teacher; in 1770 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
became professor of logic, and in 1804 he died at Königsberg
on the 12th of February, having almost attained his
eightieth year (Tennemann’s Grundriss der Geschichte der
Philosophie by Wendt, § 380, pp. 465, 466), without ever
having left his native town.</p>

<p>While to Wolff thought as thought was merely positive
self-identity and grasped itself as such, we saw the negative
self-moving thought, the absolute Notion, appear in all its
power in France; and in the <i>Aufklärung</i> it likewise made
its way to Germany in such a manner that all existence, all
action, was called upon to serve a useful purpose, <i>i.e.</i>
the implicit was done away with and everything had to be
for another; and that for which everything had to be is
man, self-consciousness, taken, however, as signifying all
men generally. The consciousness of this action in abstract
form is the Kantian philosophy. It is thus the self-thinking
absolute Notion that passes into itself which we see
making its appearance in Germany through this philosophy,
in such a way that all reality falls within self-consciousness;
it is the idealism which vindicates all moments
of the implicit to self-consciousness, but which at first itself
remains subject to a contradiction, inasmuch as it still
separates this implicit from itself. In other words the
Kantian philosophy no doubt leads reality back to self-consciousness,
but it can supply no reality to this essence
of self-consciousness, or to this pure self-consciousness, nor
can it demonstrate Being in the same. It apprehends
simple thought as having difference in itself, but does
not yet apprehend that all reality rests on this difference;
it does not know how to obtain mastery over the individuality
of self-consciousness, and although it describes
reason very well, it does this in an unthinking empiric way
which again robs it of the truth it has. Theoretically the
Kantian philosophy is the “Illumination” or <i>Aufklärung</i>
reduced to method; it states that nothing true can be known,
but only the phenomenal; it leads knowledge into consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
and self-consciousness, but from this standpoint
maintains it to be a subjective and finite knowledge. Thus
although it deals with the infinite Idea, expressing its
formal categories and arriving at its concrete claims, it yet
again denies this to be the truth, making it a simple subjective,
because it has once for all accepted finite knowledge
as the fixed and ultimate standpoint. This philosophy made
an end of the metaphysic of the understanding as an objective
dogmatism, but in fact it merely transformed it into a
subjective dogmatism, <i>i.e.</i> into a consciousness in which
these same finite determinations of the understanding persist,
and the question of what is true in and for itself has
been abandoned. Its study is made difficult by its diffuseness
and prolixity, and by the peculiar terminology found in
it. Nevertheless this diffuseness has one advantage, that
inasmuch as the same thing is often repeated, the main
points are kept before us, and these cannot easily be lost
from view.</p>

<p>We shall endeavour to trace the lines which Kant pursued.
The philosophy of Kant has in the first place a
direct relation to that of Hume as stated above (p. 370).
That is to say, the significance of the Kantian philosophy,
generally expressed, is from the very beginning to allow
that determinations such as those of universality and necessity
are not to be met with in perception, and this Hume
has already shown in relation to Locke. But while Hume
attacks the universality and necessity of the categories
generally, and Jacobi their finitude, Kant merely argues
against their objectivity in so far as they are present in
external things themselves, while maintaining them to be
objective in the sense of holding good as universal and
necessary, as they do, for instance, in mathematics and
natural science.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The fact that we crave for universality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
and necessity as that which first constitutes the objective,
Kant thus undoubtedly allows. But if universality and
necessity do not exist in external things, the question arises
“Where are they to be found?” To this Kant, as against
Hume, maintains that they must be <i>a priori</i>, <i>i.e.</i> that they
must rest on reason itself, and on thought as self-conscious
reason; their source is the subject, “I” in my self-consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
This, simply expressed, is the main point in
the Kantian philosophy.</p>

<p>In the second place the philosophy of Kant is likewise
called a critical philosophy because its aim, says Kant,
is first of all to supply a criticism of our faculties of
knowledge; for before obtaining knowledge we must inquire
into the faculties of knowledge. To the healthy
human understanding that is plausible, and to it this has
been a great discovery. Knowledge is thereby represented
as an instrument, as a method and means whereby
we endeavour to possess ourselves of the truth. Thus before
men can make their way to the truth itself they must
know the nature and function of their instrument. They
must see whether it is capable of supplying what is demanded
of it—of seizing upon the object; they must know what
the alterations it makes in the object are, in order that these
alterations may not be mixed up with the determinations of
the object itself.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This would appear as though men could
set forth upon the search for truth with spears and staves.
And a further claim is made when it is said that we must
know the faculty of knowledge before we can know. For
to investigate the faculties of knowledge means to know
them; but how we are to know without knowing, how
we are to apprehend the truth before the truth, it is impossible
to say. It is the old story of the σχολαστικός
who would not go into the water till he could swim. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
since the investigation of the faculties of knowledge is
itself knowing, it cannot in Kant attain to what it aims at
because it is that already—it cannot come to itself because
it is already with itself; the same thing happens as
happened with the Jews, the Spirit passes through the
midst of them and they know it not. At the same time
the step taken by Kant is a great and important one—that
is, the fact that he has made knowledge the subject of
his consideration.</p>

<p>On the one hand this critique of knowledge applies to
the empirical knowledge of Locke, which asserts itself to
be grounded on experience, and, on the other hand, it also
deals with what claims to be on the whole a more metaphysical
kind of philosophy—the Wolffian and German—which
had also taken up the line of proceeding on the more
empiric method which has been depicted. But this last
has at the same time kept itself separate from the merely
empiric method, inasmuch as its main efforts have been
directed towards making such categories of thought as
those of potentiality, actuality, God, &amp;c., have as their
foundation categories of the understanding, and then
reasoning from them. The Kantian philosophy is in the
first instance directed against both. Kant takes away the
objective significance of the determinations of the Wolffian
metaphysics, and shows how they must be ascribed to
subjective thought alone. At the same time Jacobi likewise
declared himself against this metaphysic, but since
he started more especially from the standpoint of the
French and Germans, his point of view was different:
he asserts that our finite thought can set forth finite
determinations alone, and thus can only consider God and
Spirit in accordance with finite relationships. On the practical
side there reigned at that time the so-called happiness
theory, since man’s inherent Notion and the way to realize
this Notion was apprehended in morality as a satisfaction
of his desires. As against this Kant has very rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
shown that it involves a heteronomy and not an autonomy
of reason—a determination through nature and consequently
an absence of freedom. But because the rational principle
of Kant was formal, and his successors could not make
any further progress with reason, and yet morality had
to receive a content, Fries and others must still be called
Hedonists though they avoid giving themselves the name.</p>

<p>In the third place, as regards the relation of the categories
to the material which is given through experience,
there is according to Kant already inherent in the subjective
determinations of thought, <i>e.g.</i> in those of cause
and effect, the capacity of themselves to bind together
the differences which are present in that material.
Kant considers thought as in great measure a synthetic
activity, and hence he represents the main question of
Philosophy to be this, “How are synthetic judgments <i>a
priori</i> possible?”<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Judgment signifies the combination of
thought-determinations as subject and predicate. Synthetic
judgments <i>a priori</i> are nothing else than a connection of
opposites through themselves, or the absolute Notion,
<i>i.e.</i> the relations of different determinations such as those
of cause and effect, given not through experience but
through thought. Space and time likewise form the connecting
element; they are thus <i>a priori</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in self-consciousness.
Since Kant shows that thought has synthetic
judgments <i>a priori</i> which are not derived from perception,
he shows that thought is so to speak concrete in itself. The
idea which is present here is a great one, but, on the other
hand, quite an ordinary signification is given it, for it is
worked out from points of view which are inherently rude
and empirical, and a scientific form is the last thing that
can be claimed for it. In the presentation of it there is a
lack of philosophical abstraction, and it is expressed in
the most commonplace way; to say nothing more of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
barbarous terminology, Kant remains restricted and confined
by his psychological point of view and empirical methods.</p>

<p>To mention one example only of his barbarous expressions,
Kant calls his philosophy (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, p. 19) a Transcendental philosophy, <i>i.e.</i> a system
of principles of pure reason which demonstrate the universal
and necessary elements in the self-conscious understanding,
without occupying themselves with objects or
inquiring what universality and necessity are; this last
would be transcendent. Transcendent and transcendental
have accordingly to be clearly distinguished. Transcendent
mathematics signifies the mathematics in which
the determination of infinitude is made use of in a pre-eminent
degree: in this sphere of mathematics we say, for
instance, that the circle consists of an infinitude of straight
lines; the periphery is represented as straight, and since
the curve is represented as straight this passes beyond the
geometric category and is consequently transcendent.
Kant, on the contrary, defines the transcendental philosophy
as not a philosophy which by means of categories passes
beyond its own sphere, but one which points out in subjective
thought, in consciousness, the sources of what may
become transcendent. Thought would thus be transcendent
if the categories of universality, of cause and effect, were
predicated of the object, for in this way men would
from the subjective element ‘transcend’ into another
sphere. We are not justified in so doing as regards the
result nor even to begin with, since we merely contemplate
thought within thought itself. Thus we do not desire to
consider the categories in their objective sense, but in so
far as thought is the source of such synthetic relationships;
the necessary and universal thus here receive the significance
of resting in our faculties of knowledge. But
from this faculty of knowledge Kant still separates the
implicit, the thing-in-itself, so that the universality and
necessity are all the time a subjective conditionment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
knowledge merely, and reason with its universality and
necessity does not attain to a knowledge of the truth.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> For
it requires perception and experience, a material empirically
given in order, as subjectivity, to attain to knowledge.
As Kant says, these form its “constituent parts”; one part
it has in itself, but the other is empirically given.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> When
reason desires to be independent, to exist in itself and to
derive truth from itself, it becomes transcendent; it transcends
experience because it lacks the other constituent,
and then creates mere hallucinations of the brain. It is
hence not constitutive in knowledge but only regulative;
it is the unity and rule for the sensuous manifold. But
this unity on its own account is the unconditioned, which,
transcending experience, merely arrives at contradictions.
In the practical sphere alone is reason constitutive. The
critique of reason is consequently not the knowing of
objects, but of knowledge and its principles, its range and
limitations, so that it does not become transcendent.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> This
is an extremely general account of what we shall now
consider in its separate details.</p>

<p>In dealing with this matter Kant adopts the plan of first
considering theoretic reason, the knowledge which relates
to outward objects. In the second place he investigates
the will as self-actualization; and, in the third place, the
faculty of judgment, the special consideration of the unity
of the universal and individual; how far he gets in this
matter we shall likewise see. But the critique of the
faculty of knowledge is the matter of main importance.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, as to the theoretic philosophy, Kant
in the Critique of Pure Reason sets to work in a psychological
manner, <i>i.e.</i> historically, inasmuch as he describes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
the main stages in theoretic consciousness. The first faculty
is sensuousness generally, the second understanding, the
third reason. All this he simply narrates; he accepts it
quite empirically, without developing it from the Notion or
proceeding by necessity.</p>

<p>a. The <i>a priori</i> fact of sensuous existence, the forms of
sensuous existence, constitute the beginning of this
transcendentalism. Kant calls the judgment of the same
the transcendental æsthetic. Nowadays æsthetic signifies
the knowledge of the beautiful. But here the doctrine of
intuition or perception is taken from the point of view of
its universality, <i>i.e.</i> from what in it pertains to the subject
as such. Perception, says Kant, is the knowledge of an
object given to us through the senses; sensuousness,
however, is the capacity of being affected by conceptions as
external. Now, according to Kant, in perception there are
to be found all manner of contents, and in dealing with this
he first of all distinguishes feeling as external, such as redness,
colour, hardness, &amp;c., and then as internal, such as
justice, wrath, love, fear, pleasurable and religious feelings,
&amp;c. He says content such as this forms the one constituent
and pertains to feeling; all this is subjective and merely
subjective. In this sensuous element there is, however, a
universal sensuous element likewise contained, which as
such does not belong to feeling in so far as it is immediately
determined; in such a content this ‘other’ consists in the
categories of space and time, which of themselves are void
and empty. The filling in is performed by the content, by
colour, softness, hardness, &amp;c., as regards space; while as
regards time, the same content, so soon as it is something
transient, or again some other content, and in particular
inward feelings are what causes the determination. Space
and time are consequently pure, <i>i.e.</i> abstract perceptions
in which we place outside of us the content of individual
sensations, either in time as succeeding one another, or in
space as separate from one another. Here we thus meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
with the division between subjectivity and objectivity, for
if we isolate the ‘alongside of’ and ‘after’ we have space
and time. It is the act of <i>a priori</i> sensuousness to project
the content; the forms of intuition or perception constitute
this pure perception.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Now everything indeed is termed
perception, even thought and consciousness; God, who
certainly pertains to thought alone, is said to be comprehended
by perception or intuition, the so-called immediate
consciousness.</p>

<p>Kant further remarks in this regard, (1) “Space is no
empirical Notion which has been derived from outward
experiences.” But the Notion is never really anything
empiric: it is in barbarous forms like this that Kant,
however, always expresses himself: “For in order that I
may relate my sensations to something outside of me, I
must presuppose space.” Of time Kant speaks in similar
terms: “In order that something outside of me may be
represented in separate space or time, the conception of
space and time must come first, or it cannot be derived
from experience, for experience first becomes possible
through this antecedent conception.” That is to say, time
and space which may appear as objective, since their
particular filling in certainly belongs to subjective feeling,
are not empirical; for consciousness has time and space
first of all in itself. (2) “Space is a necessary conception
which lies at the basis of all external perceptions. Space
and time are conceptions <i>a priori</i>, because we cannot
represent things without space and time. Time is a
necessary basis for all phenomena.” As <i>a priori</i>, space and
time are universal and necessary, that is to say we find this
to be the case; but it does not follow that they must be
previously present as conceptions. They are fundamental
indeed, but they are likewise an external universal. Kant
however places the matter somewhat in this fashion: there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
are things-in-themselves outside, but devoid of time and
space; consciousness now comes, and it has time and space
beforehand present in it as the possibility of experience,
just as in order to eat it has mouth and teeth, &amp;c., as
conditions necessary for eating. The things which are eaten
have not the mouth and teeth, and as eating is brought to
bear on things, so space and time are also brought to bear
on them; just as things are placed in the mouth and between
the teeth, so is it with space and time. (3) “Space and
time are not general Notions of the relations of things, but
pure intuitive perceptions. For we can only represent to
ourselves one space; there are not different component
parts of space.” The same is the case with time. The
abstract conception tree, for example, is in its actuality a
number of individual and separate trees, but spaces are not
such particulars, nor are they parts; for one immediate
continuity remains, and hence a simple unity. Ordinary
perception has always something individual before it; space
or time are always however one only, and therefore <i>a
priori</i>. It might however be replied to Kant: The nature
of space and time undoubtedly involves their being an
abstract universal; but there is in like manner only one
blue. (4) “Each Notion or conception certainly comprises
an infinite number of conceptions under itself, but not
within itself; nevertheless this last is the case in space and
time, and they are therefore intuitive perceptions and not
Notions or conceptions.”<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Space and time, then, are certainly
not thought-determinations, if no thoughts are there
present, but a Notion, so soon as we have a Notion of them.</p>

<p>From the transcendental point of view it is likewise
maintained that this conception of space and time contains
synthetic propositions <i>a priori</i>, connected with the consciousness
of its necessity. Examples of these synthetic
propositions are sought in statements such as that of space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
having three dimensions, or in the definition of a straight
line, that it is the shortest distance between two points,
and likewise in the statement that 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> All these
propositions are however very analytic. Kant nevertheless
in the first place holds that such propositions do not take
their rise from experience, or, as we might better express it,
are not an individual contingent perception; this is very
true, the perception is universal and necessary. In the
second place he states that we acquire them from pure
sensuous perception, and not through the understanding
or Notion. But Kant does not grasp the two together, and
yet this comprehension of them is involved in such propositions
being immediately certain even in ordinary perception.
When Kant then expresses himself (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, p. 49) to the effect that we have many sensations
which constitute “the real matter,” with which we
externally and inwardly “occupy our minds,” and that the
mind has in itself in space and time “formal conditions
of the mode in which we place them” (those manifold
feelings) “in our mind,” the question of how mind
arrives at having just these special forms now forces itself
upon us. But what the nature of time and space is, it
does not occur to the Kantian philosophy to inquire. To
it what space and time are in themselves does not signify
‘What is their Notion,’ but ‘Are they external things or
something in the mind?’</p>

<p>b. The second faculty, the understanding, is something
very different from sensuousness; the latter is Receptivity,
while Kant calls thought in general Spontaneity—an
expression which belongs to the philosophy of
Leibnitz. The understanding is active thought, I myself;
it “is the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous
perception.” Yet it has thoughts merely without real
content: “Thoughts without content are void and empty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
sensuous perceptions without Notions are blind.” The
understanding thus obtains from the sensuous its matter,
both empirical and <i>a priori</i>, time and space; and it thinks
this matter, but its thoughts are very different from this
matter. Or it is a faculty of a particular kind, and it is
only when both occur, when the sensuous faculty has
supplied material and the understanding has united to this
its thoughts, that knowledge results.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The thoughts of the
understanding as such are thus limited thoughts, thoughts
of the finite only.</p>

<p>Now logic, as transcendental logic, likewise sets forth
the conceptions which the understanding has <i>a priori</i> in
itself and “whereby it thinks objects completely <i>a priori</i>.”
Thoughts have a form which signifies their being the
synthetic function which brings the manifold into a unity.
<i>I</i> am this unity, the transcendental apperception, the pure
apperception of self-consciousness. I&nbsp;=&nbsp;I; <i>I</i> must ‘accompany’
all our conceptions.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> This is a barbarous exposition
of the matter. As self-consciousness I am the completely
void, general I, completely indeterminate and abstract;
apperception is determination generally, the activity
whereby I transplant an empirical content into my simple
consciousness, while perception rather signifies feeling or
conceiving. In order that a content may enter this One,
it must be infected by its simplicity; it is thus that the
content first becomes my content. The comprehending
medium is ‘I’; whatever I have to do with must allow
itself to be forced into these forms of unity. This is a
great fact, an important item of knowledge; what thought
produces is unity; thus it produces itself, for it is the
One. Yet the fact that I am the one and, as thinking,
the simplifier, is not by Kant satisfactorily set forth.
The unity may likewise be called relation; for in so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
a manifold is presupposed, and as this on the one side
remains a manifold while on the other side it is set forth
as one, so far may it be said to be related.</p>

<p>Now as ‘I’ is the universal transcendental unity of self-consciousness
which binds together the empirical matter
of conception generally, there are various modes in this
relationship, and here we have the transcendental nature
of the categories or universal thought-determinations.
But Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp. 70, 77) approaches
these modes of simplicity by accepting them as
they are classified in ordinary logic. For he says that in
common logic particular kinds of judgment are brought
forward; and since judgment is a special kind of relationship
of the manifold, the various functions of thought
which ‘I’ has in it are shown therein. But the following
kinds of judgment have been noticed, viz. Universal,
Particular and Singular; Affirmative, Negative, Infinite;
Categorical, Hypothetical, Disjunctive; Assertoric, Problematic
and Apodictic judgments. These particular modes
of relationship now brought forward are the pure forms of
the understanding. There are thus, according to Kant
(Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp. 75, 76, 78-82), twelve
fundamental categories, which fall into four classes; and it
is noteworthy, and deserves to be recognized, that each
species of judgment again constitutes a triad. (1) The first
kind of categories are those of Quantity, viz. Unity,
Plurality and Totality. Plurality is negation of the one,
the assertion of difference; and the third, the bringing of
the other two into one, plurality circumscribed, the indeterminate
plurality comprehended as one, is the Totality.
(2) In the second series are the categories of Quality:
Reality, Negation, Limitation. Limitation is as real or
positive as negation. (3) The third series comprises the
categories of relation, of connection; and first of all,
indeed, the relation of Substantiality, Substance and Accident:
then the relation of Causality, the relation of Cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
and Effect, and finally Reciprocity. (4) The categories of
Modality, of the relation of the objective to our thought,
come fourth, viz. Possibility, Existence (actuality) and
Necessity. Possibility should come second; in abstract
thought, however, the empty conception comes first. It
betrays a great instinct for the Notion when Kant says
that the first category is positive, the second the negative
of the first, the third the synthesis of the two. The
triplicity, this ancient form of the Pythagoreans, Neo-Platonists
and of the Christian religion, although it here
reappears as a quite external <i>schema</i> only, conceals within
itself the absolute form, the Notion. But since Kant says
that a conception can determine itself in me as accidental,
as cause, effect, unity, plurality, &amp;c., we thereby have the
whole of the metaphysics of the understanding. Kant does
not follow up further the derivation of these categories,
and he finds them imperfect, but he says that the others
are derived from them. Kant thus accepts the categories
in an empiric way, without thinking of developing of
necessity these differences from unity. Just as little did
Kant attempt to deduce time and space, for he accepted
them likewise from experience—a quite unphilosophic and
unjustifiable procedure.</p>

<p>Thinking understanding is thus indeed the source of the
individual categories, but because on their own account
they are void and empty, they only have significance
through their union with the given, manifold material of
perception, feeling, &amp;c. Such connection of sensuous
material with categories now constitutes the facts of experience,
<i>i.e.</i> the matter of sensation after it is brought under
the categories; and this is knowledge generally.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The
matter of perception which pertains to the feelings or
sensuous perception is not left in the determination of
individuality and immediacy, but I am active in relation to
it, inasmuch as I bring it into connection through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
categories and elevate it into universal species, natural
laws, &amp;c. The question of whether a completed sensuousness
or the Notion is the higher may accordingly be easily
decided. For the laws of the heavens are not immediately
perceived, but merely the change in position on the part of
the stars. It is only when this object of immediate perception
is laid hold of and brought under universal thought-determinations
that experience arises therefrom, which has
a claim to validity for all time. The category which brings
the unity of thought into the content of feeling is thus
the objective element in experience, which receives thereby
universality and necessity, while that which is perceived is
rather the subjective and contingent. Our finding both
these elements in experience demonstrates indeed that a
correct analysis has been made. Kant (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, pp. 119, 120) however connects with this the
statement that experience grasps phenomena only, and
that by means of the knowledge which we obtain through,
experience we do not know things as they are in themselves,
but only as they are in the form of laws of perception
and sensuousness. For the first component part of experience,
sensation, is doubtless subjective, since it is connected
with our organs. The matter of perception is only
what it is in my sensation. I know of this sensation only
and not of the thing. But, in the second place, the
objective, which ought to constitute the opposite to this
subjective side, is itself subjective likewise: it does not
indeed pertain to my feeling, but it remains shut up in the
region of my self-consciousness; the categories are only
determinations of our thinking understanding. Neither
the one nor the other is consequently anything in itself,
nor are both together, knowledge, anything in itself, for it
only knows phenomena—a strange contradiction.</p>

<p>The transition of the category to the empiric is made in
the following way: “Pure conceptions of the understanding
are quite of a different nature from empiric, indeed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
any sensuous perceptions;” we have thus “to show how
pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to
phenomena.” This is dealt with by the transcendental
faculty of judgment. For Kant says that in the mind, in
self-consciousness, there are pure conceptions of the understanding
and pure sensuous perceptions; now it is the
schematism of the pure understanding, the transcendental
faculty of the imagination, which determines the pure
sensuous perception in conformity with the category and
thus constitutes the transition to experience.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> The connection
of these two is again one of the most attractive
sides of the Kantian philosophy, whereby pure sensuousness
and pure understanding, which were formerly expressed
as absolute opposites, are now united. There is
thus here present a perceptive understanding or an understanding
perception; but Kant does not see this, he does not
bring these thoughts together: he does not grasp the fact
that he has here brought both sides of knowledge into one,
and has thereby expressed their implicitude. Knowledge
itself is in fact the unity and truth of both moments; but
with Kant the thinking understanding and sensuousness
are both something particular, and they are only united in
an external, superficial way, just as a piece of wood and a
leg might be bound together by a cord. Thus, for example,
the conception of substance in the <i>schema</i> becomes
permanent in time,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> <i>i.e.</i> the pure conception of the understanding,
the pure category, is brought into unity with
the form of pure sensuous perception.</p>

<p>In as far as we have to deal with our own determinations
only and as we do not reach the implicit, the true objective,
the Kantian philosophy called itself Idealism. But in this
connection Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp. 200, 201)
brings forward a refutation of empirical or material idealism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>thus: “I am conscious of my existence as determined in
time. But all time-determination presupposes something
permanent in perception. This permanence cannot be” a
sensuous perception “in me.” For all the determining
grounds of my existence which are met with in me are
conceptions, and as such themselves require a constant
element different from them, and in relation to which the
change taking place in them—consequently “my existence
in time,” in which they change, “may be determined.” Or I
am conscious of my existence as of an empirical consciousness
which is only capable of being determined in relation
to something which is outside of me; <i>i.e.</i> I am conscious
of something external to me. Conversely it may be said:
I am conscious of external things as determined in time
and as changing; these hence presuppose something constant
which is not in them but outside of them. And this
is ‘I,’ the transcendental ground of their universality and
necessity, of their implicitude, the unity of self-consciousness.
On another occasion Kant regards it thus (Kritik der
reinen Vernunft, p. 101): These moments confuse themselves,
because the constant element is itself a category.
Idealism, when we regard it as signifying that nothing
exists outside of my individual self-consciousness as individual,
as also the refutation of this, the assertion that
things exist outside of my self-consciousness as individual,
are the one as bad as the other. The former is the idealism
of Berkeley, in which self-consciousness as individual is
alone in question, or the world of self-consciousness appears
as a number of limited, sensuous, individual conceptions,
which are as completely devoid of truth as though they
were called things. The truth or untruth does not rest in
their being things or conceptions, but in their limitation
and contingency, whether as conceptions or things. The
refutation of this idealism is nothing more than calling
attention to the fact that this empirical consciousness does
not exist in itself—just as those empiric things do not exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
in themselves. But the knowing subject does not with
Kant really arrive at reason, for it remains still the individual
self-consciousness as such, which is opposed to the
universal. As a matter of fact there is described in what
we have seen only the empirical finite self-consciousness
which requires a material from outside, or which is limited.
We do not ask whether these facts of knowledge are in and
for themselves true or untrue; the whole of knowledge
remains within subjectivity, and on the other side there is
the thing-in-itself as an external. This subjectivity is however
concrete in itself; even the determinate categories of
the thinking understanding are concrete, and much more
is experience so—the synthesis of the sensation and the
category.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>c. The third faculty Kant finds in reason, to which he
advances from the understanding after the same psychological
method; that is to say, he hunts through the soul’s
sack to see what faculties are still to be found there; and
thus by merest chance he lights on Reason. It would
make no difference if there had been no Reason there, just
as with physicists it is a matter of perfect indifference
whether, for instance, there is such a thing as magnetism
or not. “All our knowledge begins from the senses,
thence proceeds to the understanding, and finishes up with
reason; nothing higher than this is to be found in us, for
it signifies the working up of the material of perception,
and the reducing of it to the highest unity of thought.”
Reason is therefore, according to Kant, the power of
obtaining knowledge from principles, that is, the power of
knowing the particular in the universal by means of
Notions; the understanding, on the contrary, reaches its
particular by means of perception. But the categories are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
themselves particular. The principle of reason, according
to Kant, is really the universal, inasmuch as it finds the
unconditioned involved in the conditioned knowledge of the
understanding. Understanding is hence for him thought
in finite relations; reason, on the contrary, is thought
which makes the unconditioned its object. Since Kant’s
time it has become customary in the language of philosophy
to distinguish understanding and reason, while
by earlier philosophers this distinction was not drawn.
The product of reason is, according to Kant, the Idea—a
Platonic expression—and he understands by it the unconditioned,
the infinite.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It is a great step forward to
say that reason brings forth Ideas; with Kant, however,
the Idea is merely the abstract universal, the indeterminate.</p>

<p>This, the unconditioned, must now be grasped as concrete,
and therein lies the main difficulty. For to know the unconditioned
means to determine it and to deduce its
determinations. Much has been written and said on the
subject of knowledge, without a definition of it ever having
been offered. But it is the business of Philosophy to see
that what is taken for granted as known is really known.
Now on this point Kant says that reason has certainly the
desire to know the infinite, but has not the power. And
the reason which Kant gives for this (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, pp. 277, 278), is on the one hand that no psychologically
sensuous intuition or perception corresponds with
the infinite, that it is not given in outward or inward experience;
to the Idea “no congruent or corresponding
object can be discovered in the sensuous world.” It
depends, however, on how the world is looked at; but experience
and observation of the world mean nothing else
for Kant than a candlestick standing here, and a snuff-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
standing there. It is certainly correct to say that the
infinite is not given in the world of sensuous perception;
and supposing that what we know is experience, a synthesis
of what is thought and what is felt, the infinite can certainly
not be known in the sense that we have a sensuous perception
of it. But no one wishes to demand a sensuous proof
in verification of the infinite; spirit is for spirit alone. The
second reason for considering that the infinite cannot be
known, lies in this, that Reason has no part in it except as
supplying the forms of thought which we call categories;
and these doubtless afford what Kant calls objective determinations,
but in such a way that in themselves they are
still only subjective. If therefore for the determination of
the infinite we employ these categories which are applicable
only to phenomena, we entangle ourselves in false arguments
(paralogisms) and in contradictions (antinomies); and it is
an important point in the Kantian philosophy that the
infinite, so far as it is defined by means of categories, loses
itself in contradictions. Although reason, says Kant,
becomes transcendent by the exhibition of these contradictions,
it still retains its claim to trace perception, experience,
and knowledge pertaining to the understanding, back to the
infinite. This union of the infinite, the unconditioned, with
the finite and conditioned as existing in the knowledge
given by the understanding, or even in perception, would
signify that the acme of concreteness had been reached.</p>

<p>Of this Unconditioned there are several kinds, objects
having special features of their own and proceeding from
reason, transcendental Ideas; they are thus themselves
particular in their nature. The manner in which Kant
arrives at these Ideas is again derived from experience, from
formal logic, according to which there are various forms of
the syllogism. Because, says Kant, there are three forms
of the syllogism, categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive,
the Unconditioned is also three-fold in its nature: “Firstly,
an Unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
Synthesis is the concrete; but the expression is ambiguous,
since it indicates an external association of independent
elements. “In the second place, an Unconditioned of the
hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series will have
to be looked for; and in the third place, an Unconditioned
of the disjunctive synthesis of the parts in a system.” We
make the first connection, expressed as object of Reason or
transcendental Idea, when we conceive “the thinking
subject;” the second “is the sum total of all phenomena,
the world;” and the third is “the thing which contains the
supreme condition of the possibility of all that can be
thought, the Being of all Beings,” <i>i.e.</i> God. When brought
to an ultimate point, the question which meets us is
whether Reason can bring these objects to reality, or whether
they remain confined to subjective thought. Now, according
to Kant, Reason is not capable of procuring reality for
its Ideas—otherwise it would be transcendent, its limits
would be overstepped; it produces only paralogisms,
antinomies, and an ideal without reality.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>α. “A. paralogism is a syllogism false in its form.”
Since Reason credits with reality that mode of the Unconditioned
which constitutes the categorical synthesis in a
subject, and therefore the thinking subject, it is termed
substance. Now is the thinking ego a substance, a soul, a
soul-thing? Further questions are whether it is permanent,
immaterial, incorruptible, personal and immortal, and such
as to have a real community with the body. The falsity
of the syllogism consists in this, that the idea of the unity of
the transcendental subject essential to Reason is expressed
as a thing; for it is only in this way that the permanency
of the same becomes substance. Otherwise I find myself
permanent in my thought, of course, but only within
perceiving consciousness, not outside of that. The ego is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
therefore the empty, transcendental subject of our thoughts,
that moreover becomes known only through its thoughts;
but of what it is in itself we cannot gather the least idea.
(A horrible distinction! For thought is nothing more or
less than the “in-itself” or implicit.) We cannot assert of
it any present Being, because thought is an empty form,
we have a conception of what thinking Beings are through
no outward experience, but only by means of self-consciousness,—<i>i.e.</i>
because we cannot take the “I” in our hands,
nor see it, nor smell it. We therefore know very well that
the ego is a subject, but if we pass beyond self-consciousness,
and say that it is substance, we go farther than we
are entitled to do. I cannot therefore assign any reality
to the subject.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>We here see Kant fall into contradiction, what with the
barbarity of the conceptions which he refutes, and the
barbarity of his own conceptions which remain behind
when the others are refuted. In the first place, he is
perfectly correct when he maintains that the ego is not a
soul-thing, a dead permanency which has a sensuous
present existence; indeed, were it to be an ordinary thing,
it would be necessary that it should be capable of being
experienced. But, in the second place, Kant does not
assert the contrary of this, namely that the ego, as this
universal or as self-thinking, has in itself the true reality
which he requires as an objective mode. For he does not
get clear of the conception of reality in which reality
consists in the possession of a sensuous present existence;
accordingly, because the ego is given in no outward
experience, it is not real. For self-consciousness, the ego
as such, is not, according to Kant, reality; it is only <i>our</i>
thought, or in other words he regards self-consciousness as
being itself simply and entirely sensuous. The form which
Kant accordingly bestows on Being, thing, substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
would seem to indicate that these categories of the understanding
were too high for the subject, too high to be
capable of being predicated of it. But really such determinations
are too poor and too mean, for what possesses
life is not a thing, nor can the soul, the spirit, the ego, be
called a thing. Being is the least or lowest quality that
one can assign to spirit, its abstract, immediate identity
with itself; Being thus no doubt pertains to spirit, but it
must be considered as a determination scarcely worth
applying to it.</p>

<p>β. In the second place we have the antinomy, <i>i.e.</i> the
contradiction in Reason’s Idea of the Unconditioned, an
Idea applied to the world in order to represent it as a
complete summing-up of conditions. That is to say, in the
given phenomena Reason demands the absolute completeness
of the conditions of their possibility, so far as these
constitute a series, so that the unconditioned is contained
in the world, <i>i.e.</i> the totality of the series. If now this
completeness is expressed as existing, an antinomy is alone
presented, and Reason is presented only as dialectic: <i>i.e.</i>
in this object there is on every side a perfect contradiction
found.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> For phenomena are a finite content, and the world
is a conjunction of the limited; if this content is now
thought by Reason, and therefore subsumed under the
unconditioned and the unlimited, we have two determinations,
finite and infinite, which contradict each other.
Reason demands a perfectly complete synthesis, an absolute
beginning; but in phenomena we have, on the contrary, a
succession of causes and effects, which never come to an
end. Kant here points out four contradictions (Kritik der
reinen Vernunft, p. 320), which, however, is not enough;
for in each Notion there are antinomies, since it is not
simple but concrete, and therefore contains different
determinations, which are direct opposites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>αα. These antinomies in the first place involve our
making the one determination, limitation, just as valid as
non-limitation. “Thesis: The world has a beginning
and an end in time, and it is limited in regard to space.
Antithesis: It has no beginning and no end in time, and
also no limits in space.” The one, says Kant, can be
proved just as easily as the other; and indeed he does prove
each indirectly, though his are not “advocate’s proofs.”<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
The world, as the universe, is the whole; it is thus a
universal idea, and therefore unlimited. The completion
of the synthesis in progression as regards time and space
is, however, a first beginning of time and space. If therefore
the categories of limited and unlimited are applied to
the world in order to attain to a knowledge of it, we fall
into contradictions, because the categories are not applicable
to things-in-themselves.</p>

<p>ββ. The second antinomy is that atoms, from which
substance is composed, must necessarily be admitted to
exist, therefore simplicity can be proved; but just as easy
is it to prove incompleteness, the endless process of
division. The thesis is accordingly stated thus: “Every
compound substance consists of simple parts,” and the
antithesis is as follows: “There exists nothing simple.”<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
The one is here the limit, a material self-existence, the
point which is likewise the enclosing surface; the other is
divisibility <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>γγ. The third antinomy is the opposition between
freedom and necessity. The first is the self-determining,
the point of view pertaining to infinity: causality according
to the laws of freedom is the only causality. The
other is: Determinism alone is to be found: everything
is determined by means of an external ground or
reason.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>δδ. The fourth antinomy rests on what follows: On the
one hand totality completes itself in freedom as a first
beginning of action, or in an absolutely necessary Being,
as the cause of the world, so that the process is interrupted:
but there is opposed to that freedom the necessity
of a process according to conditions of causes and effects,
and to the necessity of a Being is opposed the consideration
that everything is contingent. The absolute necessity of the
conditioned world is therefore on the one hand maintained
thus: “To the world belongs an absolutely necessary
Being.” The opposite to this is, “There exists no absolutely
necessary Being, either as part of the world or outside of
the world.”<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>One of these opposites is just as necessary as the
other, and it is superfluous to carry this further here.
The necessity of these contradictions is the interesting
fact which Kant (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p. 324)
has brought to consciousness; in ordinary metaphysics,
however, it is imagined that one of these contradictions
must hold good, and the other be disproved. The most
important point involved in this assertion of Kant’s is,
however, unintentional on his part. For he indeed solves
these antinomies (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp. 385,
386), but only in the particular sense of transcendental
idealism, which does not doubt or deny the existence of
external things (<i>supra</i>, p. 442), but “allows that things
are perceived in space and time” (which is the case,
whether it allows it or not): for transcendental idealism,
however, “space and time in themselves are not things at
all,” and therefore “do not exist apart from our mind;”
<i>i.e.</i> all these determinations of a beginning in time, and so
on, do not really belong to things, to the implicitude of the
phenomenal world, which has independent existence outside
of our subjective thought. If such determinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
belonged to the world, to God, to free agents, there would
be an objective contradiction; but this contradiction is
not found as absolute, it pertains only to us. Or, in other
words, this transcendental idealism lets the contradiction
remain, only it is not Being in itself that is thus contradictory,
for the contradiction has its source in our thought
alone. Thus the same antinomy remains in our mind;
and as it was formerly God who had to take upon Himself
all contradictions, so now it is self-consciousness. But the
Kantian philosophy does not go on to grapple with the fact
that it is not things that are contradictory, but self-consciousness
itself. Experience teaches that the ego does
not melt away by reason of these contradictions, but continues
to exist; we need not therefore trouble ourselves
about its contradictions, for it can bear them. Nevertheless
Kant shows here too much tenderness for things: it
would be a pity, he thinks, if they contradicted themselves.
But that mind, which is far higher, should be a contradiction—that
is not a pity at all. The contradiction is
therefore by no means solved by Kant; and since mind
takes it upon itself, and contradiction is self-destructive,
mind is in itself all derangement and disorder. The true
solution would be found in the statement that the categories
have no truth in themselves, and the Unconditioned
of Reason just as little, but that it lies in the unity of both
as concrete, and in that alone.</p>

<p>γ. Kant now goes on to the Idea of God; this third
idea is the Being of Beings, which the other ideas presupposed.
Kant says (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, pp. 441-452),
that according to the definition of Wolff, God is the
most real of all Beings; the object then comes to be to
prove that God is not only Thought, but that He is, that
He has reality, Being. This Kant calls the Ideal of
Reason, to distinguish it from the Idea, which is only the
sum of all possibility. The Ideal is thus the Idea as existent;
just as in art we give the name of ideal to the Idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
realized in a sensuous manner. Here Kant takes into
consideration the proof of the existence of God, as he asks
whether reality can be assigned to this Ideal.</p>

<p>The ontological proof proceeds from the absolute Notion,
in order from it to argue up to Being. With Anselm,
Descartes, and Spinoza the transition to Being is thus
made; and all of them assume in so doing the unity of
Being and thought. But Kant says (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, pp. 458-466): To this Ideal of Reason just as
little reality can be assigned: there is no transition from
the Notion to Being. “Being is not a real predicate,”
like any other, “a Notion of something which might
be added to the Notion of a thing. A hundred real
dollars do not contain in the very least more than a hundred
possible dollars,” they are the same content, <i>i.e.</i> the
same Notion; they are also a hundred exactly. The one is
the Notion, or rather the conception, the other is the
object; Being is no new determination of the Notion,
otherwise my Notion of a hundred real dollars would
contain something different from a hundred real dollars.
But “the object, as real, is not contained in my Notion
alone; or to my Notion the real hundred dollars are
synthetically added.” Being cannot therefore be derived
from the Notion, because it is not contained therein,
but must be added to it. “We must go out of the
Notion in order to arrive at existence. With regard to
objects of pure thought, there are no means of coming to
know of their existence, because it had to be known <i>a
priori</i>; but our consciousness of all existence belongs entirely
to experience.” That is to say, Kant does not attain
to the comprehension of that very synthesis of Notion and
Being, or in other words, he does not comprehend existence,
<i>i.e.</i> he does not attain to the establishment of it as
Notion; existence remains for him something absolutely
different from a Notion. The content is no doubt the same
for him in what exists and in the Notion: but since Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
is not involved in the Notion, the attempt to derive the one
from the other is unavailing.</p>

<p>Of course the determination of Being is not found as
positive and ready-made in the Notion; the Notion is
something different from reality and objectivity. If we
therefore abide by the Notion, we abide by Being as something
different from the Notion, and adhere to the separation
of the two; we then have conception, and not Being
at all. That a hundred possible dollars are something
different from a hundred actual ones is a reflection of a
very popular nature, so much so that no proposition has
been so well received as the assertion that no transition can
be made from the Notion to Being; for though I imagine to
myself a hundred dollars, I do not possess them for all that.
But in a like popular fashion it might be said that one must
leave off imagining, for that is mere conception: <i>i.e.</i> what
is merely imaginary is untrue, the hundred imaginary dollars
are and remain imaginary. Therefore to believe in them is
a proof of an unsound understanding, and is of no manner
of use; and he is a foolish fellow who indulges in such
fancies and wishes. One possesses a hundred dollars, when
they are real only; if a man has therefore so great a desire
to possess a hundred dollars, he must put his hand to work
in order to obtain them: <i>i.e.</i> he must not come to a standstill
at the imagination of them, but pass out beyond it.
This subjective side is not the ultimate or the absolute; the
true is that which is not merely subjective. If I possess
a hundred dollars, I have them actually, and at the same
time I form a conception of them to myself. But according
to Kant’s representation we come to a deadlock at the
difference; dualism is ultimate, and each side has independent
validity as an absolute. Against this false idea of
what is to be absolute and ultimate, the healthy human understanding
is directed; every ordinary consciousness rises
above it, every action aims at setting aside a subjective
conception and making it into something objective. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
is no man so foolish as that philosophy; when a man feels
hungry, he does not call up the imagination of food, but
sets about satisfying his hunger. All activity is a conception
which does not yet exist, but whose subjectivity is
abrogated. Moreover the imaginary hundred dollars
become real, and the real ones imaginary: this is a frequent
experience, this is their fate; it depends on circumstances
entirely outward whether a hundred dollars become my
property or not. Of course the mere conception is of no
good, if I obstinately hold by it: for I can imagine what I
will, but that does not make it exist. The only important
point is what I conceive to myself, and then whether I
think or comprehend the subjective and Being; by means
of this each passes into the other. Thought, the Notion,
of necessity implies that the Notion does not remain subjective;
this subjective is on the contrary abrogated and
reveals itself as objective. Now that unity is expressly
affirmed by Descartes solely in reference to the Notion of
God, for it is just that which is God; he speaks of no
hundred dollars, as these are not an existence which has a
Notion in itself. That opposition does away with itself
absolutely and entirely, <i>i.e.</i> the finite passes away; it holds
good only in the philosophy of finitude. If, therefore, there
is not a Notion of existence formed, we have in it a notionless,
sensuous object of perception; and what is notionless
is certainly not a Notion,—therefore sensation, handling,
are not Notions. Such existence has of course no
Absolute, no real essence: or such existence has no truth,
it is only a vanishing moment. This useless thrashing of
the empty grainless straw of the common logic is termed
philosophizing: it is like Issachar the strong ass, which
could not be made to move from the spot where it was
(Gen. xlix. 14). People of this kind say: We are
good for nothing, and because we are good for nothing,
we are good for nothing, and wish to be good for
nothing. But it is a very false idea of Christian humility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
and modesty to desire through one’s abjectness to attain
to excellence; this confession of one’s own nothingness is
really inward pride and great self-conceit. But for the
honour of true humility we must not remain in our misery,
but raise ourselves above it by laying hold of the Divine.</p>

<p>The fact to which Kant clings most strongly (Kritik der
reinen Vernunft, p. 467) is this, that Being cannot be
extracted from the Notion. The result of this is the proposition
that to have the thought of the Infinite is certainly
Reason; but that from the Idea of Reason is separated
determination in general, and especially the determination
which is known as Being. The Ideas of Reason cannot be
proved from experience, or obtain from it their verification:
if they are defined by means of categories, contradictions
arise. If the Idea in general is to be defined as existent
only, it is nothing more or less than the Notion; and the
Being of the existent is still distinguished from it. This
result, however, so highly important with reference to
knowledge of the understanding, Kant does not, with
reference to Reason, carry further than to say that Reason
has on its own account nothing but formal unity for the
methodical systematization of the knowledge of the understanding.
Abstract thinking is adhered to; it is said that
the understanding can only bring about order in things;
but order is nothing in and for itself, it is only subjective.
There therefore remains nothing for Reason except the form
of its pure identity with itself, and this extends no further
than to the arranging of the manifold laws and relations of
the understanding, the classes, kinds and species which the
understanding discovers.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> I, as Reason or conception, and
the things external to me, are both absolutely different from
one another; and that, according to Kant, is the ultimate
standpoint. The animal does not stop at this standpoint,
but practically brings about unity. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
critique of theoretical Reason which Kant gives, and in
which he states the <i>a priori</i> and determinate character of
Reason in itself, without bringing it to the determinateness
of individuality.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Mention should still be made of the positive philosophy
or metaphysics, which Kant sets <i>a priori</i> above objective
existence, the content of the object of experience, nature; we
have here his natural philosophy, which is a demonstration
of the universal conceptions of Nature. But this is on the
one hand very scanty and restricted in content, containing
as it does sundry general qualities and conceptions of
matter and motion, and with regard to the scientific side
or the <i>a priori</i>, as Kant calls it, it is likewise altogether
unsatisfactory. For Kant assumes all such conceptions as
that matter has motion and also a power of attraction and
repulsion,<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> instead of demonstrating their necessity. The
“Principles of Natural Philosophy” have nevertheless been
of great service, inasmuch as at the commencement of a
philosophy of nature, attention was called to the fact that
physical science employs thought-determinations without
further investigation; and these determinations constitute
the real foundations of its objects. Density, for instance,
is looked on by physical science as a variable
quantity, as a mere <i>quantum</i> in space: instead of this Kant
asserted it to be a certain degree of occupation of space,
<i>i.e.</i> energy, intensity of action. He demands accordingly
(Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft, pp.
65-68) a construction of matter from powers and activities,
not from atoms; and Schelling still holds to this without
getting further. Kant’s work is an attempt to think, <i>i.e.</i>
to demonstrate the determinations of thought, whose product
consists of such conceptions as matter; he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
attempted to determine the fundamental Notions and
principles of this science, and has given the first impulse
to a so-called dynamic theory of Nature.</p>

<p>“Religion within pure Reason” is also a demonstration
of dogmas as aspects of Reason, just as in Nature. Thus
in the positive dogmas of religion, which the Aufklärung
(the clearing-up)—or the Ausklärung (the clearing-out)—made
short work of, Kant called to remembrance Ideas of
Reason, asking what rational and, first of all, what moral
meaning lies in that which men call dogmas of religion, <i>e.g.</i>
original sin.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He is much more reasonable than the <i>Ausklärung</i>,
which thinks it beneath its dignity to speak of
such matters. These are the principal points in respect to
the theoretical part of Kant’s philosophy.</p>

<p>2. The second subject of review in Kant’s philosophy is
the practical sphere, the nature and principle of the will;
this subject is dealt with in the Critique of Practical Reason,
in which Kant accepted Rousseau’s conclusion that the will
is absolutely free. Kant’s idea of theoretic Reason is that
when Reason relates itself to an object, this object must be
given to it; but when the object is given by Reason to itself,
it has no truth; and Reason in knowledge of this kind
does not arrive at independence. As practical, on the contrary,
Reason is independent in itself; as a moral Being
man is free, raised above all natural law and above all
phenomena. As the theoretic Reason had in itself categories,
<i>a priori</i> distinctions, so practical Reason has in turn
the moral law in general, the further determinations of
which are constituted by the notions of duty and right, lawful
and unlawful; and here Reason disdains all the given
material which was necessary to it on the theoretic side.
The will determines itself within itself; all that is right
and moral rests on freedom; in this man has his absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
self-consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> On this side self-consciousness finds
essential reality in itself, as theoretical Reason found it in an
“other”; and in the first place, indeed, the ego in its individuality
is immediate reality, universality, objectivity; in
the second place subjectivity strives after reality, but not
after sensuous reality such as we had before, for here
Reason holds itself to be the real. Here we have the
Notion which is sensible of its own deficiency; this
theoretic Reason could not be, as in it the Notion had to
remain the Notion. Thus we have the standpoint of absoluteness
revealed, since there is an infinite disclosed within
the human breast. The satisfying part in Kant’s philosophy
is that the truth is at least set within the heart; and hence
I acknowledge that, and that alone, which is in conformity
with my determined nature.</p>

<p>a. Kant divides will into lower and higher faculties of
desire; this expression is not inapt. The lower faculties
of desire are impulses, inclinations, etc.; the higher faculty
is the will as such, which has not external, individual aims,
but universal. To the question what the principle of will
that should determine man in his actions is, all sorts of
answers have been given; for instance, self-love, benevolence,
happiness, etc. Such material principles of action,
Kant now says, are all reducible to impulses, to happiness;
but the rational in itself is purely formal, and consists in
the maxim that what is to hold good as law, must be
capable of being thought of as a law of universal application,
without destroying itself. All morality of action now
rests upon the conviction that the act is done with consciousness
of the law, for the sake of the law and out of
respect for the law and for itself, without any regard to
what makes for happiness. As a moral Being man has the
moral law in himself, the principle of which is freedom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
autonomy of the will; for the will is absolute spontaneity.
Determinations which are taken from the inclinations are
heterogeneous principles as regards the will; or the will is
heteronomy if it takes such determinations as its end and
aim; for in that case it takes its determinations from something
else than itself. But the essence of the will is to
determine itself from itself; for practical Reason gives
itself laws. But the empirical will is heteronomous, for it
is determined by desires; and they belong to our nature,
not to the realm of freedom.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>It is a highly important point in the Kantian philosophy
that what self-consciousness esteems reality, law, and implicit
Being, is brought back within itself. While a man is
striving after this aim and that, according as he judges the
world or history in one way or the other, what is he to take
as his ultimate aim? For the will, however, there is no other
aim than that derived from itself, the aim of its freedom.
It is a great advance when the principle is established that
freedom is the last hinge on which man turns, a highest
possible pinnacle, which allows nothing further to be imposed
upon it; thus man bows to no authority, and acknowledges
no obligations, where his freedom is not respected.
Great popularity has from one point of view been won for
Kantian philosophy by the teaching that man finds in himself
an absolutely firm, unwavering centre-point; but with
this last principle it has come to a standstill. While the
highest pinnacle of the theoretic Reason is abstract identity,
because it can furnish only a canon, a rule for abstract
classifications,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> practical Reason, as law-giving, is immediately
regarded as concrete; the law which it gives to
itself is the moral law. But even if it is stated that it is
concrete in itself, there is the further consideration that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
this freedom is at first only the negative of everything else;
no bond, nothing external, lays me under an obligation. It
is to this extent indeterminate; it is the identity of the will
with itself, its at-homeness with itself. But what is the
content of this law? Here we at once come back to the
lack of content. For the sole form of this principle is
nothing more or less than agreement with itself, universality;
the formal principle of legislation in this internal
solitude comes to no determination, or this is abstraction
only. The universal, the non-contradiction of self, is
without content, something which comes to be reality in
the practical sphere just as little as in the theoretical. The
universal moral law Kant therefore expresses thus (and the
setting up of such a universal form was at all times the
demand of the abstract understanding): “Act from
maxims” (the law is also to be my particular law), “which
are capable of becoming universal laws.”<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Thus for the determination of duty (for the question
which meets us is, what is duty for the free will) Kant has
contributed nothing but the form of identity, which is the
law of abstract Understanding. To defend one’s fatherland,
to promote the happiness of another, is a duty, not because
of the content, but because it is duty; as with the Stoics,
what was thought was true for the very reason that, and
in so far as it was thought (Vol. II., pp. 254, 260, 263).
The content as such is indeed not what holds good universally
in the moral law, because it contradicts itself. For
benevolence, for instance, enjoins: “Give your possessions to
the poor,” but if all give away what they have, beneficence
is done away with (Vol. I., pp. 417, 418). Even with abstract
identity, however, we do not get a step further, for every
content which is put into this form is by being so put freed
from self-contradiction. But nothing would be lost if it were
not put into this form at all. With regard to property, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
instance, the law of my actions is this: Property ought to
be respected, for the opposite of this cannot be universal
law. That is correct, but it is quite a formal determination:
If property is, then it is. Property is here presupposed,
but this determination may also in the same way be omitted,
and then there is no contradiction involved in theft: If there
is no such thing as property, then it is not respected. This
is the defect in the principle of Kant and Fichte, that it is
really formal; chill duty is the final undigested lump left
within the stomach, the revelation given to Reason.</p>

<p>The first postulate in practical Reason is thus free, independent
will which determines itself, but this concrete is
still abstract. The second and third are forms which remind
us that the will is concrete in a higher sense.</p>

<p>b. The second point is the connection of the Notion of the
will with the particular will of the individual; the concrete
is here the fact that my particular will and the universal will
are identical, or that I am a moral human being. The
unity, that man should be moral, is postulated; but beyond
the “should” and this talk of morality, no advance is made.
It is not said what is moral; and no thought is given to a
system of the self-realizing spirit. For really, as theoretic
Reason stands opposed to the objective of the senses, so
practical Reason stands opposed to the practical sensuousness,
to impulses and inclinations. Perfected morality
must remain a Beyond; for morality presupposes the
difference of the particular and universal will. It is a
struggle, the determination of the sensuous by the universal;
the struggle can only take place when the sensuous will is
not yet in conformity with the universal. The result is,
therefore, that the aim of the moral will is to be attained in
infinite progress only; on this Kant founds (Kritik der
prakt. Vernunft, pp. 219-223) the postulate of the immortality
of the soul, as the endless progress of the subject in
his morality, because morality itself is incomplete, and must
advance into infinitude. The particular will is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
something other than the universal will; but it is not
ultimate or really permanent.</p>

<p>c. The third point is the highest concrete, the Notion
of the freedom of all men, or the natural world has to
be in harmony with the Notion of freedom. That is the
postulate of the existence of God, whom Reason, however,
does not recognize. Will has the whole world, the whole
of the sensuous, in opposition to it, and yet Reason insists
on the unity of Nature or the moral law, as the Idea of the
Good, which is the ultimate end of the world. Since,
however, it is formal, and therefore has no content on its
own account, it stands opposed to the impulses and inclinations
of a subjective and an external independent Nature.
Kant reconciles the contradiction of the two (Kritik der
prakt. Vernunft, pp. 198-200) in the thought of the
highest Good, in which Nature is conformed to rational
will, and happiness to virtue;—a harmony which does not
enter into the question at all, although practical reality
consists therein. For happiness is only one’s own sensuous
consciousness, or the actuality of a particular individual,
not universal reality in itself. The unification spoken of
itself therefore remains only a Beyond, a thought, which
is not actually in existence, but only ought to be. Kant
(Kritik der prakt. Vernunft, pp. 205-209) thus agrees
entirely with the talk which alleges that in this world it
often fares ill with the good, and well with the wicked,
and so on; and he postulates further the existence of God
as the Being, the causality, through whom this harmony
comes to pass, on behalf both of the sanctity of the moral
law, and of the rational end to be attained in Nature, but
only in infinite progress; which postulate, like that of the
immortality of the soul, allows the contradiction to remain
as it is all the time, and expresses only in the abstract
that the reconciliation ought to come about. The postulate
itself is always there, because the Good is a Beyond with
respect to Nature; the law of necessity and the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
liberty are different from one another, and placed in this
dualism. Nature would remain Nature no longer, if it
were to become conformed to the Notion of the Good; and
thus there remains an utter opposition between the two
sides, because they cannot unite. It is likewise necessary
to establish the unity of the two; but this is never actual,
for their separation is exactly what is presupposed. Kant
employs popular language thus: evil ought to be overcome,
but yet must not have been overcome. God is to
him, therefore, only a faith, an opinion, which is only
subjectively, and not absolutely true.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> This result is also
of a very popular character.</p>

<p>These postulates express nothing but the synthesis,
devoid of thought, of the different moments which contradict
each other on every hand; they are therefore a
“nest”<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> of contradictions. For instance, the immortality
of the soul is postulated on account of imperfect morality,
<i>i.e.</i> because it is infected with sensuousness. But the
sensuous is implied in moral self-consciousness; the
end, perfection, is what really destroys morality as such.
Similarly the other aim, the harmony of the sensuous and
the rational, to an equal extent abrogates morality; for
that consists in this very opposition of Reason to the
sensuous. The actuality of the God who produces harmony
is of such a character that it does not enter into consciousness
at all; it is accepted by consciousness for the sake of
harmony, just as children make some kind of scarecrow,
and then agree with each other to pretend to be afraid of
it. The ground on which God is accepted—that by the
conception of a holy law-giver the moral law may acquire
additional reverence—contradicts the fact that morality
really consists in reverence for the law simply for its own
sake.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> In Practical Reason self-consciousness esteems itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
to be implicit Being, as contrasted with theoretic Reason,
which assigns implicitude to objective existence, but the
one, we see, attains just as little as the other to unity and
actuality in itself. It is hard for man to believe that Reason
actually exists: but there is nothing real except Reason; it
is the absolute power. The vanity of man aspires to have
an ideal before him, in order to be able to find fault with
everything alike. We possess all wisdom, it is within us,
but is not forthcoming. That is the ultimate standpoint;
it is a high standpoint, no doubt, but in it the truth is
never reached. The absolute Good remains “what ought
to be,” or without objectivity; and there it has to remain.</p>

<p>3. There is still left for us to consider the third side in
Kant’s philosophy, the Critique of the Faculty of Judgment,
in which the demand for the concrete comes in, the demand
that the Idea of unity spoken of before should be established
not as a Beyond, but as present; and this side is
of special importance. Kant says that the understanding
no doubt regulates in the theoretic sphere and produces
categories; but these remain mere general determinations,
beyond which lies the particular (the other element which
belongs to every item of knowledge). The two are distinguished
from one another for the understanding; for its
distinctions remain in universality. In the practical
sphere Reason is certainly the implicit, but its free independence,
its law-giving freedom in higher form, is
opposed to Nature in its freedom or to Nature’s own laws.
“In the theoretic sphere Reason can draw conclusions
from given laws through syllogisms, only by means of the
understanding, and these conclusions never get beyond
Nature; it is only in the practical sphere that Reason
itself gives laws. Understanding and” (practical) “Reason
have two different regulative systems on one and the same
ground of experience, without the one being detrimental
to the other. For if the Notion of Nature has but little
influence on the giving of laws by the Notion of Freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
just as little does the latter interfere with the legislation
of Nature. The possibility of the existence side by side of
the two regulative systems and of the powers belonging to
them was proved in the Critique of pure Reason.” (!?)
“Now if a unity is not constituted by these two different
spheres, which certainly do not put a limit on each other in
their regulative action, but do so incessantly in their operations
in the sensuous world” (<i>i.e.</i> where they encounter
each other), “the reason is this, that the Notion of Nature
represents its objects in perception, not as things
in themselves, but as mere phenomena, while the Notion
of Freedom, on the other hand, represents in its object a
thing in itself, no doubt, but not in perception. Consequently
neither of them can attain to a theoretic knowledge
of its object (and even of the thinking subject) as a thing-in-itself,
which last would be the supersensuous, an unlimited
and inaccessible realm for our whole faculty of knowledge.
Now truly there is fixed a gulf over which the eye
cannot reach, between the realm of the Notion of Nature,
as the sensuous, and the realm of the Notion of Freedom,
as the supersensuous, so that it is not possible to pass from
the one to the other, since it is just as if there were two
different worlds, the first of which could have no influence
on the second. Nevertheless the latter is conceived as
having an influence on the former, or, in other words,
freedom is conceived as having for its mission the realization
in the sensuous world of the end indicated by the
laws of freedom. Consequently Nature must be so conceived
that, while in form it realizes its own laws, there
may yet be a possibility of ends being realized in it
according to the laws of freedom. Therefore there must
surely be some ground for the unity of the supersensuous
which lies at the foundation of Nature with that which
the Notion of Freedom practically contains, the Notion of
which ground of unity, although it attains neither theoretically
nor practically to a knowledge of the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
consequently has no peculiar province, yet makes possible
the transition from the mode of thought in accordance
with the principles of the one, to the mode of thought in
accordance with the principles of the other. Between
Understanding and Reason there now comes the Faculty
of Judgment, as between the powers of knowledge and
desire there come pleasure and its opposite; in this
faculty must therefore lie the transition from the province
of the Notions of Nature to the province of the Notion of
Freedom.”<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>Adaptation to ends has its place here, <i>i.e.</i> a particular reality,
which is determined only through the universal, the end.
The understanding is the ground of this unity of the manifold;
the sensuous is therefore here determined by means
of the supersensuous. This idea of a universal which
implicitly contains the particular is according to Kant the
precise object of the faculty of judgment, which he divides
as follows:—“If the universal (the rule, principle, law) is
given, the faculty of judgment which subsumes the particular
under that universal, is determinative,”—the immediate
faculty of judgment. But here there is also a particular
which is not determined by species. “If, however, only
the particular is given, for which the faculty of judgment
has to find the universal, it is reflective.” The reflective
judgment has as its principle the unity of particularity and
the abstract universal of the understanding, the idea of a
legal necessity which is at the same time free, or of a
freedom which is directly one with its content. “This
principle can be no other but the fact that since universal
laws of Nature have their foundation in our understanding,
which prescribes them to nature, although only according
to their general conception, the particular, empirical laws,
in so far as they are undetermined by universal laws, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
be viewed as containing that unity which they would
contain if they had been given by some intelligence—other,
it may be, than our own—with express reference to our
cognitive faculties, in order to render possible a system of
experience according to particular natural laws. It is not
as if such an intelligence must be assumed (for it is only
the reflective faculty of judgment to which this idea serves
as principle): this faculty gives a law only to itself, not to
Nature in addition. Now the conception of an object (if it
at the same time contains the ground of the reality of this
object), the end, and the harmony of a thing with that
quality of things which is only possible in conformity with
ends, are termed the adaptation to purpose of the form;
therefore the principle of the faculty of judgment in respect
to the form of the things of Nature under empirical laws
in general is the adaptability to purpose of Nature in its
multiplicity. That is to say, Nature is represented by this
Notion as if an intelligence contained the ground of the
unity in multiplicity of Nature’s empirical laws.”<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Aristotle already regarded Nature as in itself showing this
adaptation to end, and as having in itself νοῦς, intelligence,
the Universal, so that in undivided unity one element is
moment of another (<i>v.</i> Vol. II. pp. 156-162). Purpose is
the Notion, and immanent; not external form and abstraction
as distinguished from a fundamental material, but penetrating,
so that all that is particular is determined by this
universal itself. According to Kant this is Understanding:
no doubt the laws of the Understanding, which it implicitly
has in knowledge, leave the objective still undetermined,
but because this manifold itself must have a connection
in itself, which is yet contingent for human intelligence,
“the faculty of judgment must assume as a principle for
its own use that what is contingent for us contains a unity,
which for us indeed is not knowable, but yet thinkable, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
the connection of the manifold with an implicitly possible
experience.”<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> This principle hereby at once falls back
again into the subjectivity of a thought, and is only a
maxim of our reflection, by which nothing is to be expressed
regarding the objective nature of the object,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
because Being-in-itself is once for all fixed outside of
self-consciousness, and the Understanding is conceived
only in the form of the self-conscious, not in its becoming
another.</p>

<p>Now this principle of the reflective faculty of judgment
is in itself a two-fold adaptation to end, the formal and the
material; the faculty of judgment is thus either æsthetic
or teleological: of these the former has to do with subjective,
the latter with objective, logical adaptation to end.
There are thus two objects of the faculty of judgment—the
beautiful in works of art and the natural products of
organic life—which make known to us the unity of the
Notion of Nature and the Notion of Freedom.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The consideration
of these works involves the fact, that we see a
unity of the Understanding and the particular. But as
this consideration is only a subjective manner of representing
such products, and does not contain the truth of the same,
such things are regarded only according to this unity, and
they are not in themselves of this nature; what they are in
themselves lies beyond.</p>

<p>a. The Beautiful of the æsthetic faculty of judgment consists
in the following: “Pleasure and displeasure are something
subjective, which can in no way become a part of knowledge.
The object has adaptation to end only to the extent
that its conception is directly bound up with the feeling of
pleasure; and this is an æsthetic conception. The taking
up of forms into the imaginative faculty can never occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
without the reflecting faculty of judgment at least comparing
them, even unintentionally, by means of its power of
relating perceptions to Notions.” Now if in this comparison
the imaginative faculty (as a faculty of perceptions <i>a
priori</i>?) “is, by means of a conception given”—something
beautiful,—“unintentionally placed in agreement with the
Understanding, as the faculty of Notions, and thereby a
feeling of pleasure is awakened, the object must then be
looked on as in conformity with end for the reflecting
faculty of judgment. Such a judgment regarding the
adaptability to end of the object, a judgment which is
grounded on no previous Notion of the object, and furnishes
no Notion of it, is an æsthetic judgment. An object whose
form (not the material of its conception as sensation) is
judged to be a cause of the pleasure which springs from the
conception of such an object, is beautiful,”—the first
reasonable thing said about beauty. The sensuous is one
moment of the Beautiful, but it must also express the
spiritual, a Notion. “The Beautiful is what is conceived
without” subjective “interest,” but similarly also “without
Notions” (<i>i.e.</i> determinations of reflection, laws) “as object
of a universal pleasure. It is related to no inclination,
therefore the subject feels itself quite free therein. It is
not beautiful <i>for me</i>. The end is the object of a Notion, so
far as the latter is looked on as the cause of the former”
(the object); “and the causality of a Notion in respect to
its object is adaptation to end.” To the ideal belongs
“the Idea of reason, which makes the aims of humanity,
as far as they cannot be sensuously conceived, the
principle of judgment of a form through which these
aims reveal themselves as their effect in the phenomenon.
The ideal we may expect to find revealed only in human
form.”</p>

<p>The sublime is the effort to give sensuous expression to
an Idea in which the inconceivability of the Idea, and the
impossibility of finding an adequate expression of it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
means of the sensuous, are clearly evidenced.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Here in the
æsthetic faculty of judgment we see the immediate unity
of the universal and the particular; for the Beautiful is
this very unity, without Notion and immediate. Because
Kant, however, places it in the subject, it is limited, and
as æsthetic it also ranks lower, inasmuch as it is not the
unity as Notion.</p>

<p>b. The other manner of bringing harmony to pass is
the teleological way of regarding Nature, which is found in
the objective and material adaptation to end. Here the
immediate unity of the Notion and reality is looked upon
as objective in the organic products of Nature—this being
the purpose of Nature, containing in its universality the
particular, in its particularity the species. But such a
mode of consideration must be practised not externally,
but in conformity with internal teleology. In external
adaptation to end one thing has its end in another: “Snow
protects the sown crops in cold lands from frost, and facilitates
the intercourse of men by permitting of sleighing.”<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
Internal adaptation to end signifies, on the contrary, that
a thing is in itself end and means, its end is not therefore
beyond itself. In the contemplation of the living creature
we do not remain at the point of having something sensuous
before us, which according to the categories of the
Understanding is only brought into relation to something
other than itself; for we regard it as cause of itself, as
producing itself. This is the self-preservation of the
living creature; as an individual it is no doubt perishable,
but in living it produces itself, although for that purpose
certain conditions are requisite. The end or purpose of
Nature is therefore to be sought for in matter, to the
extent that matter is an inwardly organized product of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
nature, “in which all is end, and all in turn is means;”<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
because all the members of the organism are at the same
time means and end, it is an end in itself. That is the
Aristotelian Notion—the infinite that returns into itself, the
Idea.</p>

<p>Kant at this point calls to mind the following: “We
should find no difference between natural mechanism and
the technique of Nature, <i>i.e.</i> the connection of ends in the
same, were our Understanding not of such a kind that it
must pass from the universal to the particular, and the
faculty of judgment can therefore pronounce no determining
sentences, without having a universal law under
which it may subsume the particular. Now the particular
as such contains a contingent element in regard to the
universal, but nevertheless Reason also demands unity in
the connection of particular laws of Nature, and consequently
a regulative character, which character when
found in the contingent is termed adaptation to end: and
the derivation of particular laws from universal is, in regard
to the element of contingency which those particular
laws contain, <i>a priori</i> impossible through the determination
of the Notion of the object; the Notion of the adaptation
to end of Nature in its products becomes thus a Notion
necessary for the human faculty of judgment, but not
affecting the determination of the objects themselves, and
therefore a subjective principle.”<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> An organic Being is
therefore, according to Kant (Kritik der Urtheilskraft,
p. 354) one in which natural mechanism and end are
identical. We regard it as if there dwelt in the sensuous
a Notion which brings the particular into conformity with
itself. In the organic products of Nature we perceive
this immediate unity of the Notion and reality; for in a
living creature there is perceived in one unity the soul, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
the universal, and existence or particularity, which is not
the case with inorganic Nature. Thus there enters into
the Kantian philosophy the conception of the concrete, as
that the universal Notion determines the particular. But
Kant took these Ideas again in a subjective sense only,
as guiding thoughts for the faculty of judgment, by which
no Being-in-itself can be expressed; and thus, although
he expresses the unity of the Notion and reality, he yet
lays fresh emphasis on the side of the Notion. He will
not therefore throw off his limitations in the moment in
which he assumes them as limitations. This is the perpetual
contradiction in Kant’s philosophy: Kant exhibited
the extremes of opposition in their one-sidedness, and expressed
also the reconciliation of the contradiction; Reason
postulates unity, and this we have also in the faculty of
judgment. Kant, however, says (Kritik der Urtheilskraft,
pp. 355-363): This is only a mode of our reflecting
faculty of judgment, life itself is not so; we are merely
accustomed so to regard it. In art it is thus certainly
the sensuous mode which gives us the conception
of the Idea; reality and ideality are here directly in one.
But at this point also Kant says that we must remain at
what is one-sided, at the very moment when he is passing
out beyond it. The wealth of thought therefore still unfolds
itself with Kant in subjective form alone; all fulness,
all content, concentrates in conceiving, thinking, postulating.
The objective, according to Kant, is only what is
in itself; and we know not what Things-in-themselves
are. But Being-in-itself is only the <i>caput mortuum</i>, the
dead abstraction of the “other,” the empty, undetermined
Beyond.</p>

<p>The reason why that true Idea should not be the truth
is therefore that the empty abstractions of an understanding
which keeps itself in the abstract universal, and
of a sensuous material of individuality standing in opposition
to the same, are presupposed as the truth. Kant no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
doubt expressly advances to the conception of an intuitive
or perceiving understanding, which, while it gives universal
laws, at the same time determines the particular;
and the determination thus given is deep; it is the true
concrete, reality determined by the indwelling Notion, or,
as Spinoza says, the adequate Idea. For “to knowledge
there also belongs intuitive perception, and the possession
of a perfect spontaneity of intuition would be a faculty
of knowledge” specifically “distinct from the sensuous,
and quite independent thereof, and therefore it would be
understanding in the most universal sense. Consequently
it is possible to think of an intuitive understanding which
does not pass from the universal to the particular, and thus
proceed through conceptions to the individual—an understanding
in which we do not meet with the contingency
of the harmony of Nature in her products, according to
particular laws, with the understanding, a contingency
which makes it so hard for our understanding to bring”
together “into the unity of knowledge the manifold of
Nature.” But that this “<i>intellectus archetypus</i>” is the
true Idea of the understanding, is a thought which does
not strike Kant. Strange to say, he certainly has this
idea of the intuitive; and he does not know why it should
have no truth—except because our understanding is
otherwise constituted, namely such “that it proceeds
from the analytic universal to the particular.”<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> But absolute
Reason and Understanding in itself, as we have
already seen (pp. 432, 461), are, in Kant’s view, of such a
nature that they have no reality in themselves: the Understanding
requires material to work upon, theoretic Reason
spins cobwebs of the brain, practical Reason has to allow
its reality to come to an end with its postulates. In spite
of their directly and definitely expressed non-absoluteness,
they are yet looked on as true knowledge; and intuitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
Understanding, which holds Notion and sensuous perception
in one unity, is looked on as a mere thought which
we make for ourselves.</p>

<p>c. The highest form in which the conception of the
concrete comes into Kant’s philosophy is this, that the end
is grasped in its entire universality; and thus it is the
Good. This Good is an Idea; it is my thought; but there
exists the absolute demand that it should be realized also
in the world, that the necessity of Nature should correspond
with the laws of freedom, not as the necessity of an
external Nature, but through what is right and moral in
human life, through life in the State,—or in other words
that the world in general should be good. This identity of
the Good and reality is the demand of practical Reason; but
subjective Reason cannot realize this. In every good
action a man no doubt accomplishes something good, but
this is only limited; universal Good, as the final object of
the world, can be attained to only through a third. And
this power over the world, which has as its final object the
Good in the world, is God.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Thus the Critique of the
Faculty of Judgment also ends with the postulate of God.
Now, although the particular laws of Nature, as independent
individual relations, have no relation to the Good,
Reason consists in having and desiring unity as the
essential or substantial in itself. The opposition of these
two, the Good and the world, is contrary to that identity;
Reason must therefore demand that this contradiction
should be abrogated, that there should be a power which is
good on its own account, and is a Power over Nature. This
is the position which God assumes in Kant’s philosophy:
no proof is possible, he says, of God’s existence, but the
demand is there. The deficiency here is the impossibility
of proving God’s existence, and it consists in this, that if
we admit Kant’s dualism, it cannot be shown how the Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
as abstract Idea in itself is the abrogating of its Idea as
abstract; and how the world in itself is the abrogating of
itself in its externality, and in its diversity from the Good—this
being done in order that both may reveal themselves
to be their truth, which in respect to them appears
as the Third, but is at the same time determined as the
First. Thus, therefore, according to Kant (Kritik der
Urtheilskraft, pp. 460, 461), God can only be believed in.
We associate the faith of Jacobi with this; for in this point
Kant agrees with Jacobi.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>If now, in accordance with this standpoint of Kant and
Jacobi, God is believed in, and we admit this standpoint
for an instant, there is certainly a return to the Absolute.
But the question remains: What is God? To define Him
as supersensuous is not much, nor is it more to say He is
universal, abstract, absolute. What then is His determination?
Were we here, however, to pass over to
determinations of the Absolute, the evil result would
follow, as far as this standpoint is concerned, that we
should pass over to knowledge; for this signifies knowledge
of an object which is in itself concrete, <i>i.e.</i> determined.
But here the furthest point reached is the general statement
that God exists with the determination of being infinite,
universal, indeterminate. God cannot be known in this
way; for in order to be known He must as concrete possess
at least two determinations. In this way mediation would
be established, for a knowledge of the concrete is at
once a mediate knowledge. But this standpoint lacks
mediation, and thus remains at the immediate. Paul,
in speaking to the Athenians, appeals to the altar which
they had dedicated to the Unknown God, and declares to
them what God is; but the standpoint indicated here takes
us back to the Unknown God. All the life of Nature, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
of Spirit, is mediation in itself; and to this mediation the
philosophy of Schelling now passed on.</p>

<p>If we sum up the Kantian philosophy, we find on all
hands the Idea of Thought, which is in itself the absolute
Notion, and has in itself difference, reality. In the
theoretic and practical Reason it has only abstract difference,
but in the Faculty of Judgment, as the unity of the
two, Kant goes so far as to establish the difference as
actual, establishing not only particularity, but also individuality.
But, to be sure, this Philistine conception
proceeds from our human faculty of knowledge, which is
valid for him in its empirical form, notwithstanding his
statement that it does not know the truth, and his further
description of the true idea of the same as being merely a
thought which we possess. Therefore actuality counts as
something sensuous, empirical, for the comprehension of
which Kant takes the categories of the Understanding,
giving them the same validity as they have in every-day
life. This is a complete philosophy of the Understanding,
which renounces Reason: the reason why it became so
popular was the negative one, that men were once for all
free from the old metaphysic. According to Kant something
sensuous is produced, having thought-determinations,
which, however, is not the thing, for if a man, for instance,
feels something hard, Kant says: “I feel hardness, but I
do not feel Something.” Kant’s philosophy thus ends
with a dualism, with the relation which is a plainly essential
“ought,” with the unreconciled contradiction. It is otherwise
with Jacobi’s faith; he finds the conception of God
as immediate existence, and all mediation is untrue for
him. With Kant, therefore, the result is: “We know
only phenomena;” with Jacobi, on the other hand, it is:
“We know only the finite and conditioned.” Over these
two results there has been unmingled joy among men,
because the sloth of Reason (Heaven be praised!) considered
itself liberated from every call to reflect, and now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
being saved the trouble of penetrating to its own inward
meaning and exploring the depths of Nature and
Spirit, it could very well leave itself alone. The further
result attending this is the autocracy of the subjective
Reason, which, seeing that it is abstract and without
knowledge, has only subjective certainty and not objective
truth. The second cause of rejoicing was the concession to
freedom of a perfect right, which I can neither understand
nor justify, and need not do so; my subjective liberty of
conviction and certainty holds good all round. The third
cause of joy was added by Jacobi, who said that it amounted
even to a crime to seek to know the truth, because the
infinite was thereby only rendered finite. Truth is in a
bad way, when all metaphysic is done away with, and
the only philosophy acknowledged is not a philosophy at
all!</p>

<p>But besides the general idea of synthetic judgments <i>a
priori</i>, a universal which has difference in itself, Kant’s
instinct carried this out in accordance with the scheme of
triplicity, unspiritual though that was, in the whole system
into which for him the entire universe was divided. This
he not only practised in the three critiques, but he also
followed it out in most of the sub-divisions under the
categories, the ideas of Reason, &amp;c. Kant has therefore
set forth as a universal scheme the rhythm of knowledge,
of scientific movement; and has exhibited on all sides thesis,
antithesis and synthesis, modes of the mind by means of
which it is mind, as thus consciously distinguishing itself.
The first is existence, but in the form of Other-Being for
consciousness; for what is only existence is object.
The second is Being-for-self, genuine actuality; here the
reverse relation enters in, for self-consciousness, as the
negative of Being-in-itself, is itself reality. The third is
the unity of the two; the absolute, self-conscious actuality
is the sum of true actuality, into which are re-absorbed both
the objective and the independently existent subjective.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
Kant has thus made an historical statement of the moments
of the whole, and has correctly determined and distinguished
them: it is a good introduction to Philosophy. The defect
of Kant’s philosophy consists in the falling asunder of the
moments of the absolute form; or, regarded from the other
side, our understanding, our knowledge, forms an antithesis
to Being-in-itself: there is lacking the negative, the
abrogation of the “ought,” which is not laid hold of. But
thought and thinking had become once for all an absolute
requisite that could no longer be set aside. It was consequently
in the first place demanded by consistency that
particular thoughts should appear as if produced of necessity
from the original unity of the ego, and in that way justified.
But, in the second place, thought had spread itself over the
world, had attached itself to everything, investigated everything,
introduced its forms into everything, and systematized
everything, so that on every hand thought-determinations
had to be followed, instead of any mere feeling or
routine or practical common-sense, or what is evidenced in
the extraordinary lack of understanding on the part of
so-called practical men. And therefore in theology, in
governments and their legislation, in the object aimed at
by the state, in trades and in mechanics, it is said that men
ought to act according to universal determinations, <i>i.e.</i> rationally:
and men even talk of a rational brewery, a rational
brick-kiln, etc. This is the requisite of concrete thought;
while in the Kantian result, which is that of phenomenon,
an empty thought was alone present. It is verily also the
essence of revealed religion to know what God is. There
was, therefore, to be found a yearning desire for content,
for truth, since man could not possibly return to the condition
of a brute, nor yet sink to the form of sensation, so
that this yearning was for him the only thing that held good
with regard to the higher life. The first requirement—consistency—Fichte
sought to satisfy; the other—content—Schelling
strove to fulfil.</p>

<h2><a id="c479">C. <span class="smcap">Fichte.</span></a></h2>

<p>Fichte created a great sensation in his time; his philosophy
is the Kantian philosophy in its completion, and, as
we must specially notice, it is set forth in a more logical
way. He does not pass beyond the fundamentals of Kant’s
philosophy, and at first regarded his own philosophy as no
more than a systematic working out of the other.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> In addition
to these systems of philosophies, and that of Schelling,
there are none. Any that pretend to be such merely pick
out something from these, and over this they fight and
wrangle among themselves. <i>Ils se sont battus les flancs,
pour être de grands hommes.</i> For in those times there were
in Germany many systems of philosophy, such as those of
Reinhold, Krug, Bouterweck, Fries, Schulze, &amp;c.; but in
them there is only an extremely limited point of view, combined
with boastfulness—a strange medley of stray thoughts
and conceptions or facts which I find within me. But their
thoughts are all derived from Fichte, Kant, or Schelling—that
is in so far as there are thoughts there present at all.
Or else some slight modification is added, and this for the
most part merely consists in making the great principles
barren, what points in them were living are destroyed, or else
subordinate forms are changed, whereby another principle
is said to be set forth, though when we look closer we find
that these principles are but the principles of one of those
philosophies that have gone before. This may serve as a
justification for my not speaking further of all these philosophies;
any exposition of them would be no more than a
demonstration that everything in them is taken from Kant,
Fichte, or Schelling, and that the modification in form is
only the semblance of a change, while really it indicates a
deterioration in the principles of those philosophies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>Johann Gottlieb Fichte was born on the 19th of May,
1762, at Rammenau, near Bischoffswerda, in Upper Lusatia.
He studied at Jena, and for some time was a private
tutor in Switzerland. He wrote a treatise on Religion,
termed a “Critique of all Revelation,” where the
Kantian phraseology is employed throughout—so much so
that it was thought to be the work of Kant. After this he
was in 1793 summoned to Jena by Goethe as Professor of
Philosophy, which appointment he, however, resigned in
the year 1799, on account of an unpleasantness which had
arisen through his essay “On the ground of our Belief in a
Divine Government of the World.” For Fichte published
a journal in Jena, and a paper in it which was by someone
else was regarded as atheistical. Fichte might have kept
silence, but he published the above-mentioned essay as an
introduction to the article. The authorities wished an
investigation to be made into the matter. Then Fichte
wrote a letter which contained threats, and respecting it
Goethe said that a Government ought not to allow itself to be
threatened. Fichte now taught privately for some time in
Berlin; in 1805 he became professor at Erlangen, and in
1809 at Berlin, at which place he died on the 27th January,
1814.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> We cannot here deal more particularly with the
details of his life.</p>

<p>In what is termed the philosophy of Fichte a distinction
must be made between his properly-speaking speculative
philosophy, in which the argument is most consistently
worked out, and which is less well known, and his popular
philosophy, to which belong the lectures delivered in Berlin
before a mixed audience, and, for example, the work termed
a “Guidance to a Blessed Life.” These last have much in
them that is affecting and edifying—many who call themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
the disciples of Fichte know this side alone—and they
are expressed in language most impressive to a cultured,
religious temperament. In the history of Philosophy, however,
such cannot be taken into consideration, although
through their matter they may have the highest possible
value; the content has to be speculatively developed, and
that is done in Fichte’s earlier philosophic works alone.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<h3><a id="c481">1. <span class="smcap">The First Principles of Fichte’s Philosophy.</span></a></h3>

<p>As we mentioned above (p. 478), the shortcoming in the
Kantian philosophy was its unthinking inconsistency,
through which speculative unity was lacking to the whole
system; and this shortcoming was removed by Fichte. It
is the absolute form which Fichte laid hold of, or in other
words, the absolute form is just the absolute Being-for-self,
absolute negativity, not individuality, but the Notion of
individuality, and thereby the Notion of actuality; Fichte’s
philosophy is thus the development of form in itself. He
maintained the ego to be the absolute principle, so that
from it, the direct and immediate certainty of self, all the
matter in the universe must be represented as produced;
hence, according to Fichte, reason is in itself a synthesis of
Notion and actuality. But this principle he once more in
an equally one-sided manner set aside; it is from the very
beginning subjective, conditioned by an opposite, and its
realization is a continual rushing onward in finitude, a looking
back at what has gone before. The form in which it
is presented has also the disadvantage, and indeed, the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
drawback of bringing the empiric ego ever before one’s
eyes, which is absurd, and quite distracting to one’s point
of view.</p>

<p>The claims of Philosophy have advanced so far that in
the first place self-consciousness refuses any longer to
regard absolute essence as immediate substance which does
not in itself possess difference, reality, and actuality.
Against this substance self-consciousness ever struggled,
for it does not find its explicit Being there, and consequently
feels the lack of freedom. But besides this it
demanded that this essence, objectively presented, should
be personal, living, self-conscious, actual, and not shut up
in abstract metaphysical thoughts alone. On the other
hand consciousness, for which the other is, demanded the
moment of external actuality, Being as such, into which
thought must pass, truth in objective existence; and this
is what we more especially noticed in connection with the
English. This Notion, which is immediately actuality, and
this actuality which is immediately its Notion, and that
indeed in such a way that there neither is a third thought
above this unity, nor is it an immediate unity which does
not possess difference, separation, within it, is the ego; it
is the self-distinction of opposites within itself. That
whereby it distinguishes itself from the simplicity of
thought, and distinguishes this other, is likewise immediately
for it; it is identical with, or not distinguished from
it.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Hence it is pure thought, or the ego is the true synthetic
judgment <i>a priori</i>, as Kant called it. This principle
is apprehended actuality, for the taking back of the other-Being
into self-consciousness is just apprehension. The
Notion of the Notion is from this point of view found in
the fact that in what is apprehended self-consciousness has
the certainty of itself; what is not apprehended is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
foreign to it. This absolute Notion or this absolutely
existent infinitude it is which has to be developed in knowledge,
and its distinction as the whole distinction of the
universe has to be represented from itself, and this has in
its distinction to remain reflected within itself in equal
absoluteness. Nothing other than the ego anywhere exists,
and the ego is there because it is there; what is there is
only in the ego and for the ego.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Now Fichte merely set forth this Notion; he did not
bring it to a scientific realization from itself. For to
him this Notion maintains and asserts itself as this Notion; it
has absoluteness for him in so far as it is merely the unrealized
Notion, and thus indeed comes once more into
opposition with reality. The Fichtian philosophy has the
great advantage of having set forth the fact that Philosophy
must be a science derived from one supreme principle, from
which all determinations are necessarily derived. The important
point is this unity of principle and the attempt to
develop from it in a scientifically consistent way the whole
content of consciousness, or, as has been said, to construct
the whole world.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Beyond this no progress was made.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
But the great necessity in Philosophy is to possess one
living Idea; the world is a flower which is eternally produced
from one grain of seed. Thus Fichte does not, like
Kant, throw his work into narrative form because he begins
with the ego; but he has proceeded further, inasmuch as
he sought to bring about a construction of determinations
of knowledge from the ego. The whole extent of knowledge
in all the world must be developed, and further this
knowledge must be the consequence of the development of
determinations; but because Fichte says that what is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
for us does not concern us, he has not grasped this principle
of the ego as Idea, but solely in the consciousness of
the activity which we exercise in knowing, and consequently
it is still laid hold of in the form of subjectivity.</p>

<p>Thus as Kant treats of cognition [Erkennen], so Fichte
sets forth real knowledge [Wissen]. Fichte states that the
task of Philosophy is to find a theory of knowledge; universal
knowledge is both the object and the starting-point
of Philosophy. Consciousness knows, that is its nature;
the end of philosophic learning is the knowledge of this
knowledge. Hence Fichte called his philosophy the Theory
of Knowledge (Begriff der Wissenschaftslehre, p. 18), the
science of knowledge. That is to say ordinary consciousness
as the active ego finds this and that, occupies itself,
not with itself, but with other objects and interests, but the
necessity that I bring forth determinations, and which determinations—cause
and effect, for example,—lies beyond
my consciousness: I bring them forth instinctively and
cannot get behind my consciousness. But when I philosophize,
I make my ordinary consciousness itself my object,
because I make a pure category my consciousness: I know
what my ego is doing, and thus I get behind my ordinary
consciousness. Fichte thus defines Philosophy as the artificial
consciousness, as the consciousness of consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>a. Where Fichte in his system has attained the highest
degree of determinateness, he begins, as we saw Kant
did before (pp. 437, 438), from the transcendental unity of
self-consciousness; in it I—as this—am one, this unity is
to Fichte the same and the original. Ego is there a fact,
says Fichte, but not yet a proposition. As proposition, as
principle, the ego must not remain barren, nor be accepted
as one, for to a proposition pertains a synthesis. Now
Fichte proceeds in his system from the fact that Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
must begin with an absolutely unconditioned, certain principle,
with something indubitably certain in ordinary
knowledge. “It cannot be proved or defined, because it
must be absolutely the first principle.”<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> According to
Wendt’s account (Tennemann’s Grundriss, § 393, pp. 494,
495) Fichte gives an exposition of the necessity of such a
principle as follows: “Scientific knowledge is a system of
cognition obtained through a supreme principle which
expresses the content and form of knowledge. The theory
of knowledge is the science of knowledge which sets forth
the possibility and validity of all knowledge, and proves
the possibility of principles in reference to form and
content, the principles themselves, and thereby the
connection existing in all human knowledge. It must have
a principle which can neither be proved from it nor from
another science; for it is supreme. If there is a theory of
knowledge there also is a system; if there is a system there
is also a theory of knowledge and an absolute first
principle—and so on through an inevitable circle.”<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The simple principle of this knowledge is certainty of
myself, which is the relation of me to myself; what is in
me, that I know. The supreme principle, as immediate and
not derived, must be certain on its own account; that is,
a determination of the ego only, for it is only from the ego
that I cannot abstract.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Fichte thus begins, like Descartes,
with ‘I think, therefore I am,’ and he expressly brings this
proposition to mind. The Being of the ego is not a dead,
but a concrete Being; but the highest Being is thought.
Ego, as an explicitly self-existent activity of thought, is
thus knowledge, even if it is only abstract knowledge, as
in the beginning at least it cannot help being. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
same time Fichte begins from this absolute certainty with
quite other necessities and demands; for from this ego not
only Being but also the larger system of thought has to be
derived (<i>supra</i>, p. 230). According to Fichte, the ego
is the source of the categories and ideas, but all conceptions
and thoughts are a manifold reduced to a synthesis
through Thought. Thus while with Descartes in connection
with the ego other thoughts appear which we simply find
already in us, such as God, nature, &amp;c., Fichte sought for a
philosophy entirely of a piece, in which nothing empiric
was to be admitted from without. With this reflection a
false point of view was at once introduced, namely that
contained in the old conception of knowledge, of commencing
with principles in this form and proceeding from
them; so that the reality which is derived from such a principle
is brought into opposition with it, and hence in truth is
something different, <i>i.e.</i> it is not derived: or that principle
for this same reason expresses only the absolute certainty
of itself and not the truth. The ego is certain, it cannot
be doubted; but Philosophy desires to reach the truth.
The certainty is subjective, and because it is made to remain
the basis, all else remains subjective also without there being
any possibility of this form being removed. Fichte now
analyzes the ego, reducing it to three principles from which
the whole of knowledge has to be evolved.</p>

<p>α. The first proposition must be simple, in it predicate
and subject must be alike; for were they unlike, their
connection—since in accordance with their diversity the
determinations are not directly one—would have to be
first of all proved by means of a third. The first principle
must thus be identical. Fichte now proceeds further to
distinguish in this first principle the form and content;
but in order that this same may be immediately true
through itself, form and content must be again the same,
and the principle conditioned by neither. It signifies
A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A, the abstract undetermined identity; that is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
proposition of contradiction, wherein A is an indifferent
content. Fichte says, “Thought is by no means essence,
but only a particular determination of Being; there are
outside of it many other determinations of our Being. I
merely remark this, that when ‘I am’ is overstepped,
Spinozism is necessarily reached. Its unity is something
which ought to be produced through us, but which cannot
be so; it is not anything that is.” The first proposition
is then that I am identical with myself, Ego&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ego;<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
that undoubtedly is the definition of the ego. The subject
and the predicate are the content; and this content of the
two sides is likewise their relation, <i>i.e.</i> form. Relation
requires two sides; the relating and the related are here,
however, the same; for on account of the simplicity of the
ego, there is nothing but a relation of the ego to the ego.
I have knowledge of myself; but in so far as I am consciousness,
I know of an object which is different from me,
and which is then likewise <i>mine</i>. But the ego is in such
a way identical with its difference that what is different
is immediately the same, and what is identical is likewise
different; we have a difference without a difference. Self-consciousness
is not dead identity, or non-Being, but the
object which is identical with me. This is immediately
certain; all else must be as certain to me, inasmuch as it
must be my relation to myself. The content must be
transformed into the ego, so that in it I have <i>my</i> determination
alone. This principle is at first abstract and deficient,
because in it no difference, or a formal difference
only is expressed; whereas the principle should possess a
content: a subject and a predicate are indeed distinguished
in it, but only for us who reflect upon it, <i>i.e.</i> in itself
there is no difference, and consequently no true content.
In the second place, this principle is indeed the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
certainty of self-consciousness, but self-consciousness
is likewise consciousness, and in it there is likewise the
certainty that other things exist to which it stands in an
attitude of opposition. In the third place, that principle
has not the truth in it, for the very reason that the certainty
of itself possessed by the ego has no objectivity;
it has not the form of the differentiated content within it—or
it stands in opposition to the consciousness of an
“other”.</p>

<p>β. Now in order that determination should come to pass,
<i>i.e.</i> a content and difference, it is essential for Fichte that
a second principle should be established, which in regard
to form is unconditioned, but the content of which is conditioned,
because it does not belong to the ego. This
second principle, set forth under the first, is, “I
assert a non-ego in opposition to the ego,” and in this
something other than absolute self-consciousness is set
forth.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> To this pertains the form therein present, relation;
but the content is the non-ego, another content from the
ego. We might say that through this content the proposition
is independent, since the negative therein is an
absolute, as truly as the reverse—that it is independent
through the form of opposition which cannot be derived
from the original. Here, then, we have no more to do
with derivation, although this derivation of opposition from
the first proposition was all the same demanded. Inasmuch
as I posit another in opposition to the ego, I posit
myself as not posited; this non-ego is the object generally,
<i>i.e.</i> that which is opposed to me. This other is the negative
of the ego; thus when Fichte called it the non-ego he
was expressing himself in a very happy, suitable, and consistent
manner. There has been a good deal of ridicule
cast on the ego and non-ego; the expression is new,
and therefore to us Germans it seems strange at first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
But the French say <i>Moi</i> and <i>Non-moi</i>, without finding
anything laughable in it. In this principle the positing
belongs, however, to the ego; but because the non-ego
is independent of the ego, we have two sides,
and self-consciousness relates itself to another. This
second proposition thus signifies that I posit myself
as limited, as non-ego; but non-ego is something quite
new to be added. On the one side we thus have before
us a field which is merely appropriated from the ego;
and in this way we have before us the non-ego as our
object.</p>

<p>γ. To these is added yet a third proposition, in which I
now make this division into ego and non-ego: it is the
synthetic principle, the proposition of ground, which in
content is unconditioned, just as in the second was the
case in regard to form. This third proposition is the determination
of the first two through one another, in such a
way that the ego limits the non-ego. “In and through the
ego both the ego and the non-ego are posited as capable of
being mutually limited by means of one another, <i>i.e.</i> in
such a way that the reality of the one abrogates the reality
of the other.” In limitation both are negated, but “only
in part”; only thus are synthesis and deduction possible.
I posit the non-ego, which is for me, in myself, in my
identity with myself; thus I take it from its non-identity,
its not-being-I, that is to say I limit it. This limitation
of the non-ego Fichte expresses thus: “I place in opposition
to the ego,” and indeed “to the divisible ego, a
divisible non-ego.” The non-ego I destroy as a complete
sphere, which it was according to the second principle, and
posit it as divisible; I likewise posit the ego as divisible
in so far as the non-ego is present in it. The whole sphere
which I have before me is supposed indeed to be the ego,
but in it I have not one but two. The proposition of
ground is thus the relation of reality and negation, <i>i.e.</i> it is
limitation; it contains the ego limited by the non-ego, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
the non-ego limited by the ego.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Of this synthesis there
is nothing, properly speaking, contained in the two earlier
propositions. Even this first presentation of the three
principles does away with the immanence of real knowledge.
Thus the presentation is here also subject to an
opposite from the first, as it is with Kant, even if these are
two acts of the ego merely, and we remain entirely in the
ego.</p>

<p>Now that limitation may take place for me in two
different ways: at one time the one is passive, at another
time the other is so. In this limitation the ego may posit
the non-ego as limiting and itself as limited, in such a way
that the ego posits itself as requiring to have an object;
I know myself indeed as ego, but determined by the non-ego;
non-ego is here active and ego passive. Or, on
the other hand, the ego, as abrogating other-being, is
that which limits, and non-ego is the limited. I know
myself then as clearly determining the non-ego, as the
absolute cause of the non-ego as such, for I can think.
The first is the proposition of the theoretic reason, of
intelligence: the second the proposition of practical
reason, of will.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The will is this, that I am conscious of
myself as limiting the object; thus I make myself exercise
activity upon the object and maintain myself. The theoretic
proposition is that the object is before me and it
determines me. The ego is, since I perceive, a content,
and I have this content in me, which is thus outside of me.
This is on the whole the same thing as we meet with in
the experience of Kant: it comes to the same thing
whether it is by matter or the non-ego that the ego is here
determined.</p>

<p>b. In the theoretic consciousness the ego, although the
assertive generally, finds itself limited by the non-ego.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
But it is identical with itself; hence its infinite activity
ever sets itself to abrogate the non-ego and to bring forth
itself. Now the different methods whereby the ego sets
forth itself are the different methods of its activity; these
we have to understand in their necessity. But since philosophic
knowledge is the consideration of consciousness
itself (<i>supra</i>, p. 483), I can only know knowledge, the act of
the ego. Fichte thus appeals to consciousness, postulates
ego and non-ego in their abstraction, and since philosophic
knowledge is the consciousness of consciousness, it is not
sufficient that I should find its determinations in consciousness,
for I produce them with consciousness. Common
consciousness, indeed, likewise brings forth all the determinations
of the ordinary conception and of thought, but
without—on the theoretic side at least—having any knowledge
of it; for it is the fact of being limited alone that is
present to it. Thus, when I see a large square object,
such as a wall, my ordinary consciousness accepts these
determinations as they are given to it; the object <i>is</i>. In
so doing I do not think of seeing, but of the object; seeing,
however, is my activity, the determinations of my faculty
of sensation are thus posited through me.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The ego as
theoretic is, indeed, aware in philosophic consciousness that
it is the ego which posits; but here it posits that the non-ego
posits somewhat in me. The ego thus posits itself as
that which is limited by the non-ego. I make this limitation
mine; thus is it for me in me, this passivity of the ego
is itself the activity of the ego. As a matter of fact, all
reality which appears in the object for the ego is a determination
of the ego,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> just as the categories and other
determinations were in Kant’s case. Thus it is here more
especially that we should expect Fichte to demonstrate the
return of other-Being into absolute consciousness. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
because after all the other-Being was regarded as
unconditioned, as implicit, this return does not come to
pass. The ego determines the ‘other,’ indeed, but this
unity is an altogether finite unity; non-ego has thus
immediately escaped from determination once more and
gone forth from this unity. What we find is merely an
alternation between self-consciousness and the consciousness
of another, and the constant progression of this
alternation, which never reaches any end.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The development of theoretic reason is the following-out
of the manifold relationships between the ego and non-ego;
the forms of this limitation which Fichte now goes through
are the determinations of the object. These particular
thought-determinations he calls categories, and he seeks to
demonstrate them in their necessity; from the time of
Aristotle onwards no one had thought of so doing. The
first of these forms is the determination of reciprocity,
which we already met with in the third proposition: “By
the determination of the reality or negation of the ego, the
negation or reality of the non-ego is equally determined;”
the two in one is reciprocal action. In the second place,
“Causality is the same degree of activity in the one as of
passivity in the other.” In so far as something is considered
as the reality of the non-ego, the ego is considered
as passive, and, on the other hand, in so far as ‘I’ am real,
the object is passive; this relation, that the passivity of
the object is my activity or reality, and the opposite, is the
conception of Causality. “As many parts of negation as
the ego posits in itself, so many parts of reality it posits in
the non-ego; it therefore posits itself as self-determining
in so far as it is determined, and as suffering determination
in so far as it determines itself. In so far,” in the third
place, “as the ego is regarded as embracing the whole
absolutely determined realm of all reality, it is substance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
on the other hand when it is posited in a not absolutely
determined sphere of this realm, in so far there is an
accidence in the ego.”<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> That is the first rational attempt
that has ever been made to deduce the categories; this
progress from one determination to another is, however,
only an analysis from the standpoint of consciousness, and
is not in and for itself.</p>

<p>The ego is so far the ideal ground of all conceptions of
the object; all determination of this object is a determination
of the ego. But in order that it may be object, it must
be placed in opposition to the ego, <i>i.e.</i> the determinations
set forth through the ego are another, the non-ego; this
placing of the object in opposition is the real ground of
conceptions. The ego is, however, likewise the real ground
of the object; for it is likewise a determination of the ego
that the non-ego as object is set in opposition to the ego.
Both, the real ground and the ideal ground of the conception,
are thus one and the same.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Regarding the ego as
ideal principle and the non-ego as real principle, Krug has
likewise talked a great deal of nonsense. Regarded from
the one point of view, the ego is active and the non-ego
purely passive; while from the other side the ego is passive
and the object active and operative. But since the ego in
the non-philosophic consciousness does not have the
consciousness of its activity in the conception of the
object, it represents to itself its own activity as foreign,
<i>i.e.</i> as belonging to the non-ego.</p>

<p>We here see the opposition adopting various forms: ego,
non-ego; positing, setting in opposition; two sorts of
activity of the ego, &amp;c. The fact that I represent is undoubtedly
my activity, but the matter of main importance
is the content of the positing and its necessary connection
through itself. If one occupies oneself only with this content,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
that form of subjectivity which is dominant with
Fichte, and which remains in his opposition, disappears.
As the ego is affirmative and determining, there now is in
this determination a negative likewise present; I find myself
determined and at the same time the ego is like itself,
infinite, <i>i.e.</i> identical with itself. This is a contradiction
which Fichte indeed endeavours to reconcile, but in spite of
it all he leaves the false basis of dualism undisturbed. The
ultimate, beyond which Fichte does not get, is only an
‘ought,’ which does not solve the contradiction; for while
the ego should be absolutely at home with itself, <i>i.e.</i> free,
it should at the same time be associated with another. To
Fichte the demand for the solution of this contradiction
thus adopts the attitude of being a demanded solution only,
of signifying that I ever have to destroy the barriers,
that I ever have to reach beyond the limitation into utter
infinitude, and that I ever find a new limit; a continual
alternation takes place between negation and affirmation,
an identity with self which again falls into negation, and
from this negation is ever again restored. To speak of
the bounds of human reason is, however, an unmeaning
form of words. That the reason of the subject is limited is
comprehensible from the nature of the case, but when we
speak of Thought, infinitude is none other than one’s own
relation to self, and not to one’s limit; and the place in
which man is infinite is Thought. Infinitude may then be
likewise very abstract, and in this way it is also once more
finite; but true infinitude remains in itself.</p>

<p>Fichte further deduces the ordinary conception thus:
the fact that the ego in going forth at once finds its activity
checked by a limitation, and returns once more into itself,
brings about two opposite tendencies in me, between which
I waver, and which I try to unite in the faculty of imagination.
In order that a fixed determination may exist
between the two, I have to make the limit a permanent
one, and we have that in the understanding. All further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
determinations of the object are, as categories of the understanding,
modes of synthesis; but each synthesis is a new
contradiction. New mediations are thus once more necessary,
and these are new determinations. Thus Fichte
says: I can always continue to determine the non-ego, to
make it my conception, <i>i.e.</i> to take from it its negation
as regards me. I have to deal with my activity alone; but
there is always an externality therein present which still
remains, and which is not explained by my activity. This
Beyond which alone remains to the undetermined ego
Fichte calls the infinite check upon the ego, with which it
ever has to deal, and beyond which it cannot get; thus
the activity which proceeds into infinitude finds itself
checked and driven back by this repulsive force, and then
it reacts upon itself. “The ego in its self-determination
has been considered both as determining and determined;
if we reflect on the fact that the absolutely determined
determining power must be an absolutely indeterminate,
and further, that ego and non-ego are absolutely opposed
to one another, in the one case ego is the indeterminate
and in the other case non-ego.”<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as the ego here makes the object its conception
and negates it, this philosophy is Idealism, in which
philosophy all the determinations of the object are ideal.
Everything determinate which the ego possesses it has
through its own positing; I even make a coat or a boot
because I put them on. There remains only the empty
repulsive force, and that is the Kantian Thing-in-itself,
beyond which even Fichte cannot get, even though the
theoretic reason continues its determination into infinitude.
“The ego as intelligence” ever “remains dependent on
an undetermined non-ego; it is only through this that it is
intelligence.”<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The theoretic side is thus dependent. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
it we have not therefore to deal with the truth in and for
itself, but with a contingent, because ego is limited, not
absolute, as its Notion demands: intelligence is not here
considered as spirit which is free. This is Fichte’s
standpoint as regards the theoretic side.</p>

<p>c. Practical reason comes next; the point of view from
which it starts is that “The ego posits itself as determining
the non-ego.” Now the contradiction has thus to be
solved of ego being at home with itself, since it determines
its Beyond. The ego is thus infinite activity, and, as ego =
ego, the absolute ego, it is undoubtedly abstract. But in
order to have a determination, a non-ego must exist; ego
is thus activity, causality, the positing of the non-ego.
But as with Kant sensuousness and reason remain opposed,
the same contradiction is present here, only in a more
abstract form, and not in the rude empiricism of Kant.
Fichte here turns and twists in all sorts of ways, or he
gives the opposition many different forms; the crudest form
is that ego is posited as causality, for in it another is necessitated
on which it exercises its activity. “The absolute
ego has accordingly to be” now “the cause of the non-ego,
<i>i.e.</i> only of that in the non-ego which remains when
we abstract from all demonstrable forms of representation
or conception—of that to which is ascribed the check
given to the infinitely operative activity of the ego; for
the fact that the intelligent ego is, in accordance with
the necessary laws of the conception, the cause of the
particular determinations of that which is conceived as
such, is demonstrated in the theoretic science of knowledge.”<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
The limits of intelligence must be broken
through, the ego must alone be active; the other side, the
infinite repulsion, must be removed, in order that the ego
may be liberated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>“According to our hypothesis the ego must now posit
a non-ego absolutely, and without any ground, <i>i.e.</i> absolutely
and without any ground it must limit or in part not posit
itself.” This, indeed, it already does as intelligent. “It
must therefore have the ground of not positing itself” only
“in itself.” The ego is, however, just the ego, it posits
itself, “it must” therefore “have the principle of positing
itself within it, and also the principle of not positing itself.
Hence the ego in its essence would be contradictory and
self-repellent; there would be in it a two-fold or contradictory
principle, which assumption contradicts itself, for in
that case there would be no principle within it. The ego
would” consequently “not exist, for it would abrogate
itself. All contradictions are reconciled through the further
determination of contradictory propositions. The ego
must be posited in one sense as infinite, and in another
as finite. Were it to be posited as infinite and finite in
one and the same sense, the contradiction would be insoluble;
the ego would not be one but two. In so far
as the ego posits itself as infinite, its activity is directed
upon itself and on nothing else but itself. In so
far as the ego posits limits, and itself in these limits, its
activity is not exercised directly on itself, but on a non-ego
which has to be placed in opposition,” upon another and
again upon another, and so on into infinitude; that is the
object, and the activity of the ego “is objective activity.”<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
In this way Fichte in the practical sphere also remains at
opposition, only this opposition now has the form of two
tendencies in the ego, both of which are said to be one
and the same activity of the ego. I am called upon to
proceed to determine the other in relation to which I am
negative, the non-ego, in accordance with my freedom;
it has indeed all determinations through the activity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the ego, but beyond my determination the same non-ego
ever continues to appear. The ego clearly posits an object,
a point of limitation, but where the limitation is, is undetermined.
I may transfer the sphere of my determination,
and extend it to an infinite degree, but there always
remains a pure Beyond, and the non-ego has no positive
self-existent determination.</p>

<p>The last point in respect of the practical sphere is hence
this, that the activity of the ego is a yearning or striving<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>—like
the Kantian “ought”; Fichte treats this with great
prolixity. The Fichtian philosophy consequently has the
same standpoint as the Kantian; the ultimate is always
subjectivity, as existent in and for itself. Yearning, according
to Fichte, is divine; in yearning I have not forgotten
myself, I have not forgotten that I possess a
superiority in myself; and therefore it is a condition of
happiness and satisfaction. This infinite yearning and desire
has then been regarded as what is highest and most
excellent in the Beautiful, and in religious feelings likewise;
and with it is connected the irony of which we have spoken
before (Vol. I. pp. 400, 401). In this return the ego is
merely an effort, on its side it is fixed, and it cannot
realize its endeavours. Striving is thus an imperfect or
implicitly limited action. The ultimate result is consequently
a “circle” which cannot be broken through, so
that “the finite spirit must necessarily posit an absolute
outside itself (a thing-in-itself), and yet on the other hand
it must recognize that this same is only there for it (a
necessary noumenon).”<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> To put it otherwise, we see the
ego absolutely determined in opposition only, we see it
only as consciousness and self-consciousness which does
not get beyond this, and which does not reach so far as to
Spirit. The ego is the absolute Notion in so far as it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
not yet reach the unity of thought, or in this simplicity
does not reach difference, and in motion does not have
rest; that is to say, in so far as positing, or the pure
activity of the ego, and setting in opposition, are not by it
comprehended as the same. Or the ego does not comprehend
the infinite repulsion, the non-ego; self-consciousness
determines the non-ego, but does not know how to
make this Beyond its own.</p>

<p>The deficiency in the Fichtian philosophy is thus firstly
that the ego retains the significance of the individual, actual
self-consciousness, as opposed to that which is universal or
absolute, or to the spirit in which it is itself a moment
merely; for the individual self-consciousness simply signifies
standing apart as far as another is concerned. Hence, if
the ego was ever called absolute existence, the most terrible
offence was given, because really the ego only came before
us as signifying the individual subject as opposed to the
universal.</p>

<p>In the second place, Fichte does not attain to the idea of
Reason as the perfected, real unity of subject and object,
or of ego and non-ego; it is only, as with Kant, represented
as the thought of a union in a belief or faith, and
with this Fichte likewise concludes (Grundlage der gesammten
Wissenschaftslehre, p. 301). This he worked out in
his popular writings. For because the ego is fixed in its
opposition to the non-ego, and <i>is</i> only as being opposed, it
becomes lost in that unity. The attainment of this aim is
hence sent further and further back into the false, sensuous
infinitude: it is a progression implying just the same contradiction
as that found in Kant, and having no present
actuality in itself; for the ego has all actuality in its
opposition only. The Fichtian philosophy recognizes the
finite spirit alone, and not the infinite; it does not recognize
spirit as universal thought, as the Kantian philosophy
does not recognize the not-true; or it is formal. The
knowledge of absolute unity is apprehended as faith in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
moral disposition of the world, an absolute hypothesis in
accordance with which we have the belief that every moral
action that we perform will have a good result.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> As in
Kant’s case, this Idea belongs to universal thought. “In
a word, when anything is apprehended it ceases to be God;
and every conception of God that is set up is necessarily that
of a false God. Religion is a practical faith in the moral
government of the world; faith in a supersensuous world
belongs, according to our philosophy, to the immediate
verities.”<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Fichte thus concludes with the highest Idea,
with the union of freedom and nature, but a union of such
a nature that, immediately regarded, it is not known;
the opposition alone falls within consciousness. This union
of faith he likewise finds in the Love of God. As believed
and experienced, this form pertains to Religion, and not to
Philosophy, and our only possible interest is to know this
in Philosophy. But with Fichte it is still associated with
a most unsatisfying externality of which the basis is the
non-Idea, for the one determination is essential only because
the other is so, and so on into infinitude. “The theory
of knowledge is realistic—it shows that the consciousness
of finite beings can only be explained by presupposing an
independent and wholly opposite power, on which, in accordance
with their empirical existence, they themselves
are dependent. But it asserts nothing more than this
opposed power, which by finite beings can merely be <i>felt</i>
and not known. All possible determinations of this power
or of this non-ego which can come forth into infinity in
our consciousness, it pledges itself to deduce from the
determining faculties of the ego, and it must actually be
able to deduce these, so certainly as it is a theory of knowledge.
This knowledge, however, is not transcendent but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
transcendental. It undoubtedly explains all consciousness
from something independent of all consciousness, but it
does not forget that this independent somewhat is again a
product of its own power of thought, and consequently
something dependent on the ego, in so far as it has to be
there for the ego. Every thing is, in its ideality, dependent
upon the ego; but in its reality even the ego is dependent.
The fact that the finite spirit must posit for itself
somewhat outside of itself, which last exists only for it,
is that circle which it may infinitely extend but never
break through.” The further logical determination of the
object is that which in subject and object is identical, the
true connection is that in which the objective is the possession
of the ego; as thought, the ego in itself determines
the object. But Fichte’s theory of knowledge regards the
struggle of the ego with the object as that of the continuous
process of determining the object through the
ego as subject of consciousness, without the identity of the
restfully self-developing Notion.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, because the ego is thus fixed in its one-sidedness,
there proceeds from it, as representing one
extreme, the whole of the progress that is made in the content
of knowledge; and the deduction of the philosophy of
Fichte, cognition in its content and form, is a progression
from certain determinations to others which do not turn
back into unity, or through a succession of finitenesses
which do not have the Absolute in them at all. The absolute
point of view, like an absolute content, is wanting. Thus
the contemplation of nature, for instance, is a contemplation
of it as of pure finitenesses from the point of view of
another, as though the organic body were regarded thus:
“Consciousness requires a sphere entirely its own for its
activity. This sphere is posited through an original,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
necessary activity of the ego, in which it does not know
itself as free. It is a sensuous perception, a drawing of
lines; the sphere of activity thereby becomes something
extended in space. As quiescent, continuous, and yet
unceasingly changing, this sphere is matter, which, as body,
has a number of parts which in relation to one another are
called limbs. The person can ascribe to himself no body
without positing it as being under the influence of
another person. But it is likewise essential that I should
be able to check this same influence, and external matter is
also posited as resisting my influences on it, <i>i.e.</i> as a tough,
compact matter.”<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> These tough matters must further be
separated from one another—the different persons cannot
hold together like one mass of dough. For “my body is
my body and not that of another; it must further operate
and be active without my working through it. It is only
through the operation of another that I can myself be
active and represent myself as a rational being who can be
respected by him. But the other being should treat me
immediately as a rational being, I should be for him a
rational being even before my activity begins. Or my
form must produce an effect through its mere existence in
space, without my activity, <i>i.e.</i> it must be visible. The reciprocal
operation of rational beings must take place without
activity; thus a subtle matter must be assumed in order
that it may be modified by means of the merely quiescent
form. In this way are deduced first Light and then Air.”<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
This constitutes a very external manner of passing
from one step to another, resembling the method of the
ordinary teleology, which makes out, for instance, that
plants and animals are given for the nourishment of mankind.
This is how it is put: Man must eat, and thus there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
must be something edible—consequently plants and animals
are at once deduced; plants must have their root in something,
and consequently the earth is forthwith deduced.
What is altogether lacking is any consideration of the
object as what it is in itself; it is plainly considered only in
relation to another. In this way the animal organism
appears as a tough, tenacious matter which is “articulated”
and can be modified; light is a subtle matter which is the
medium of communication of mere existence, &amp;c.—just as
in the other case plants and animals are merely edible. As
regards a philosophic consideration of the content there
is nothing at all to be found.</p>

<p>Fichte likewise wrote both a Science of Morals and of
Natural Rights, but he treats them as sciences pertaining
to the understanding only, and his method of procedure is
destitute of ideas and carried on by means of a limited
understanding. The Fichtian deduction of the conceptions
of justice and morality thus remains within the limitations
and rigidity of self-consciousness, as against which Fichte’s
popular presentations of religion and morality present
inconsistencies. The treatise on Natural Rights is a special
failure, <i>e.g.</i> where he, as we have just seen (p. 502), deduces
even nature just as far as he requires it. The organization
of the state which is described in Fichte’s Science of Rights
is furthermore as unspiritual as was the deduction of natural
objects just mentioned, and as were many of the French
constitutions which have appeared in modern times—a
formal, external uniting and connecting, in which the
individuals as such are held to be absolute, or in which
Right is the highest principle. Kant began to ground
Right upon Freedom, and Fichte likewise makes freedom
the principle in the Rights of Nature; but, as was the case
with Rousseau, it is freedom in the form of the isolated
individual. This is a great commencement, but in order to
arrive at the particular, they have to accept certain
hypotheses. The universal is not the spirit, the substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
of the whole, but an external, negative power of the finite
understanding directed against individuals. The state is
not apprehended in its essence, but only as representing a
condition of justice and law, <i>i.e.</i> as an external relation of
finite to finite. There are various individuals; the whole
constitution of the state is thus in the main characterized
by the fact that the freedom of individuals must be limited
by means of the freedom of the whole.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> The individuals
always maintain a cold attitude of negativity as regards
one another, the confinement becomes closer and the bonds
more stringent as time goes on, instead of the state being
regarded as representing the realization of freedom.</p>

<p>This philosophy contains nothing speculative, but it
demands the presence of the speculative element. As the
philosophy of Kant seeks in unity its Idea of the
Supreme Good, wherein the opposites have to be united,
so the Fichtian philosophy demands union in the ego
and in the implicitude of faith; in this self-consciousness
in all its actions makes its starting-point conviction,
so that in themselves its actions may bring forth the
highest end and realize the good. In the Fichtian
philosophy nothing can be seen beyond the moment of
self-consciousness, of self-conscious Being-within-self, as in
the philosophy of England we find expressed—in just as
one-sided a way—the moment of Being-for-another, or of
consciousness, and that not as a moment simply, but as the
principle of the truth; in neither of the two is there the
unity of both—or spirit.</p>

<p>Fichte’s philosophy constitutes a significant epoch in
Philosophy regarded in its outward form. It is from him
and from his methods that abstract thought proceeds,
deduction and construction. Hence with the Fichtian
philosophy a revolution took place in Germany. The public
had penetrated as far as the philosophy of Kant, and until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
the Kantian philosophy was reached the interest awakened
by Philosophy was general; it was accessible, and men were
curious to know about it, it pertained to the ordinary knowledge
of a man of culture (<i>supra</i>, p. 218). Formerly men
of business, statesmen, occupied themselves with Philosophy;
now, however, with the intricate idealism of the
philosophy of Kant, their wings droop helpless to the
ground. Hence it is with Kant that we first begin to find
a line of separation which parts us from the common modes
of consciousness; but the result, that the Absolute cannot
be known, has become one generally acknowledged. With
Fichte the common consciousness has still further separated
itself from Philosophy, and it has utterly departed from
the speculative element therein present. For Fichte’s ego
is not merely the ego of the empiric consciousness, since
general determinations of thought such as do not fall within
the ordinary consciousness have likewise to be known and
brought to consciousness; in this way since Fichte’s time
few men have occupied themselves with speculation. Fichte,
it is true, in his later works especially, wrote with a view to
meeting the popular ear as we may see in the “Attempt to
force the reader into comprehension,” but this end was not
accomplished. The public was through the philosophy of
Kant and Jacobi strengthened in its opinion—one which it
accepted <i>utiliter</i>—that the knowledge of God is immediate,
and that we know it from the beginning and without
requiring to study, and hence that Philosophy is quite
superfluous.</p>

<h3><a id="c505">2. <span class="smcap">Fichte’s System in a Re-constituted Form.</span></a></h3>

<p>The times called for life, for spirit. Now since mind has
thus retreated within self-consciousness, but within self-consciousness
as a barren ego, which merely gives itself a
content or a realization through finitenesses and individualities
which in and for themselves are nothing, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
next stage is found in knowing this realization of self-consciousness
in itself, in knowing the content in itself as a
content which, penetrated throughout by spirit, is self-conscious
and spiritual, or a spirit full of content. In his
later popular works Fichte thus set forth faith, love, hope,
religion, treating them without philosophic interest, and as
for a general public: it was a philosophy calculated to
suit enlightened Jews and Jewesses, councillors and
Kotzebues. He places the matter in a popular form: “It
is not the finite ego that is, but the divine Idea is the
foundation of all Philosophy; everything that man does of
himself is null and void. All existence is living and active
in itself, and there is no other life than Being, and no other
Being than God; God is thus absolute Being and Life.
The divine essence likewise comes forth, revealing and
manifesting itself—the world.”<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> This immediate unity of
the self-conscious ego and its content, or spirit, which
merely has an intuition of its self-conscious life and knows
it as the truth immediately, manifested itself subsequently
in poetic and prophetic tendencies, in vehement aspirations,
in excrescences which grew out of the Fichtian philosophy.</p>

<h3><a id="c506">3. <span class="smcap">The more Important of the Followers of Fichte.</span></a></h3>

<p>On the one hand, in respect of the content which the
ego reaches in the philosophy of Fichte, the complete
absence of spirituality, the woodenness, and, to put it
plainly, the utter foolishness therein evidenced, strike us too
forcibly to allow us to remain at his standpoint; our
philosophic perception likewise tells us of the one-sidedness
and deficiencies of the principle, as also of the
evident necessity that the content should prove to be what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
it is. But on the other hand self-consciousness was therein
posited as reality or essence—not as a foreign, alien
self-consciousness, but as ego—a signification which all
possess, and which finds an answer in the actuality of all.
The Fichtian standpoint of subjectivity has thus retained
its character of being unphilosophically worked out, and
arrived at its completion in forms pertaining to sensation
which in part remained within the Fichtian principle,
while they were in part the effort—futile though it was—to
get beyond the subjectivity of the ego.</p>

<h4><a id="c507">a. <span class="smcap">Friedrich von Schlegel.</span></a></h4>

<p>In Fichte’s case the limitation is continually re-appearing;
but because the ego feels constrained to break through
this barrier, it reacts against it, and gives itself a resting-place
within itself; this last ought to be concrete, but it is a
negative resting-place alone. This first form, Irony, has
Friedrich von Schlegel as its leading exponent. The subject
here knows itself to be within itself the Absolute, and all
else to it is vain; all the conclusions which it draws for
itself respecting the right and good, it likewise knows how
to destroy again. It can make a pretence of knowing all
things, but it only demonstrates vanity, hypocrisy, and
effrontery. Irony knows itself to be the master of every
possible content; it is serious about nothing, but plays
with all forms. The other side is this, that subjectivity has
cast itself into religious subjectivity. The utter despair in
respect of thought, of truth, and absolute objectivity, as
also the incapacity to give oneself any settled basis or
spontaneity of action, induced the noble soul to abandon
itself to feeling and to seek in Religion something
fixed and steadfast; this steadfast basis, this inward satisfaction,
is to be found in religious sentiments and feelings.
This instinct impelling us towards something fixed has
forced many into positive forms of religion, into Catholicism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
superstition and miracle working, in order that they may
find something on which they can rest, because to inward
subjectivity everything fluctuates and wavers. With the
whole force of its mind subjectivity tries to apply itself to
what is positively given, to bend its head beneath the
positive, to cast itself, so to speak, into the arms of externality,
and it finds an inward power impelling it so to
do.</p>

<h4><a id="c508">b. <span class="smcap">Schleiermacher.</span></a></h4>

<p>On the other hand the ego finds in the subjectivity and
individuality of the personal view of things the height of
all its vanity—its Religion. All the various individualities
have God within themselves. Dialectic is the last thing
to arise and to maintain its place. As this is expressed
for philosophic self-consciousness, the foreign intellectual
world has lost all significance and truth for ordinary
culture; it is composed of three elements, a deity
pertaining to a time gone by, and individualized in space
and existence, a world which is outside the actuality of
self-consciousness, and a world which had yet to appear,
and in which self-consciousness would first attain to its
reality. The spirit of culture has deserted it, and no
longer recognizes anything that is foreign to self-consciousness.
In accordance with this principle, the spiritual living
essence has then transformed itself into self-consciousness,
and it thinks to know the unity of spirit immediately from
itself, and in this immediacy to be possessed of knowledge
in a poetic, or at least a prophetic manner. As regards the
poetic manner, it has a knowledge of the life and person of
the Absolute immediately, by an intuition, and not in the
Notion, and it thinks it would lose the whole as whole,
as a self-penetrating unity, were it not to express the
same in poetic form; and what it thus expresses poetically
is the intuition of the personal life of self-consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
But the truth is absolute motion, and since it is a motion of
forms and figures [Gestalten], and the universe is a kingdom
of spirits, the Notion is the essence of this movement, and
likewise of each individual form; it is its ideal form [Form]
and not the real one, or that of figure [Gestalt]. In the
latter case necessity is lost sight of; individual action,
life and heart, remain within themselves, and undeveloped;
and this poetry vacillates betwixt the universality of the
Notion and the determinateness and indifference of the figure;
it is neither flesh nor fish, neither poetry nor philosophy.
The prophetic utterance of truths which claim to be philosophical,
thus belongs to faith, to self-consciousness, which
indeed perceives the absolute spirit in itself, but does not
comprehend itself as self-consciousness, since it places
absolute reality above Knowledge, beyond self-conscious
reason, as was done by Eschenmayer and Jacobi. This
uncomprehending, prophetic manner of speech affirms this
or that respecting absolute existence as from an oracle, and
requires that each man should find the same immediately
in his own heart. The knowledge of absolute reality
becomes a matter pertaining to the heart; there are a
number of would-be inspired speakers, each of whom holds
a monologue and really does not understand the others,
excepting by a pressure of the hands and betrayal of dumb
feeling. What they say is mainly composed of trivialities, if
these are taken in the sense in which they are uttered; it is
the feeling, the gesture, the fulness of the heart, which first
gives them their significance; to nothing of more importance
is direct expression given. They outbid one another in
conceits of fancy, in ardent poetry. But before the Truth
vanity turns pale, spitefully sneering it sneaks back into
itself. Ask not after a criterion of the truth, but after the
Notion of the truth in and for itself; on that fix your gaze.
The glory of Philosophy is departed, for it presupposes a
common ground of thoughts and principles—which is what
science demands—or at least of opinions. But now particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
subjectivity was everything, each individual was
proud and disdainful as regards all others. The conception
of independent thought—as though there could be a
thought which was not such (Vol. I. p. 60)—is very
much the same; men have, it is said, to bring forth a particularity
of their own, or else they have not thought for
themselves. But the bad picture is that in which the artist
shows himself; originality is the production of what is in
its entirety universal. The folly of independent thought is
that it results in each bringing forth something more
preposterous than another.</p>

<h4><a id="c510a">c. <span class="smcap">Novalis.</span></a></h4>

<p>Subjectivity signifies the lack of a firm and steady basis,
but likewise the desire for such, and thus it evermore
remains a yearning. These yearnings of a lofty soul are
set forth in the writings of Novalis. This subjectivity
does not reach substantiality, it dies away within itself, and
the standpoint it adopts is one of inward workings and fine
distinctions; it signifies an inward life and deals with the
minutiæ of the truth. The extravagances of subjectivity constantly
pass into madness; if they remain in thought they
are whirled round and round in the vortex of reflecting
understanding, which is ever negative in reference to
itself.</p>

<h4><a id="c510b">d. <span class="smcap">Fries, Bouterweck, Krug.</span></a></h4>

<p>Yet a last form of subjectivity is the subjectivity of
arbitrary will and ignorance. It maintained this, that the
highest mode of cognition is an immediate knowledge as a
fact of consciousness; and that is so far right. The Fichtian
abstraction and its hard understanding has a repellent
effect on thought; slothful reason allowed itself to be told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
the result of the philosophy of Kant and Jacobi, and
renounced all consistent thought, all construction. This
arbitrariness gave itself entire liberty—the liberty of the
<i>Tabagie</i>—but in doing so it regarded itself from a poetic or
prophetic point of view, as we have just seen (pp. 508,
509). Then it was both more sober and more prosaic, and
thus brought the old logic and metaphysic once more into
evidence, though with this modification that they are made
facts of consciousness. Thus Fries turns back to the faith
of Jacobi in the form of immediate judgments derived from
reason, and dark conceptions incapable of utterance.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> He
wished to improve the critique of pure reason by apprehending
the categories as facts of consciousness; anything
one chooses can in such a case be introduced. Bouterweck
speaks of “The virtue, the living nature of power; the
fact that subject and object are regarded as one, that is as
absolute virtue. With this absolute virtue we have all
Being and action, namely the eternal, absolute and pure
unity; in one word we have grasped the world within us
and we have grasped ourselves in the world, and that
indeed not through conceptions and conclusions, but directly
through the power which itself constitutes our existence
and our rational nature. To know the All, or indeed to
know God in any way, is, however, impossible for any
mortal.”<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Krug wrote a “Groundwork of Philosophy,”
setting forth a “Transcendental Synthesis—that is a
transcendental realism and a transcendental idealism inseparably
bound together,” It is an “original, transcendental
synthesis of the real and the ideal, the thinking
subject and the corresponding outer world;” this transcendental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
synthesis must “be recognized and asserted
without any attempt being made at explaining it.”<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>It was Schelling, finally, who made the most important,
or, from a philosophic point of view, the only important
advance upon the philosophy of Fichte; his philosophy rose
higher than that of Fichte, though undoubtedly it stood in
close connection with it; indeed, he himself professes to be
a Fichtian. Now the philosophy of Schelling from the
first admitted the possibility of a knowledge of God, although
it likewise started from the philosophy of Kant, which
denies such knowledge. At the same time Schelling makes
Jacobi’s principle of the unity of thought and Being fundamental,
although he begins to determine it more closely.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
To him concrete unity is this, that the finite is no more
true than the infinite, the subjective idea no more than
objectivity, and that combinations in which both untruths
are brought together in their independence in relation to
one another, are likewise combinations of untruths merely.
Concrete unity can only be comprehended as process and as
the living movement in a proposition. This inseparability
is in God alone; the finite, on the other hand, is that which
has this separability within it. In so far as it is a truth it
is likewise this unity, but in a limited sphere, and for that
reason in the separability of both moments.</p>

<p>Frederick Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, born on the 27th
January, 1775, at Schorndorf,<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> in Wurtemberg, studied in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
Leipzig and Jena, where he came to be on terms of great
intimacy with Fichte. In the year 1807 he became secretary
of the Academy of Science in Munich. We cannot with
propriety deal fully with his life, for he is still living.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Schelling worked out his philosophy in view of the public.
The series of his philosophic writings also represents the
history of his philosophic development and the gradual process
by which he raised himself above the Fichtian principle
and the Kantian content with which he began. It does
not thus contain a sequence of separately worked out
divisions of Philosophy, but only successive stages in his own
development. If we ask for a final work in which we shall
find his philosophy represented with complete definiteness
none such can be named. Schelling’s first writings are still
quite Fichtian, and it is only by slow degrees that he worked
himself free of Fichte’s form. The form of the ego has
the ambiguity of being capable of signifying either the
absolute Ego or God, or ego in my particularity;<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> this
supplied the first stimulus to Schelling. His first and quite
short work of four sheets which he wrote in 1795 at
Tubingen, while still at the university, was called, “On the
Possibility of any Form of Philosophy”; it contains propositions
respecting the Fichtian philosophy only. The next
work, “On the Ego as principle of Philosophy, or on the
Unconditioned in Human Knowledge” (Tubingen, 1795),
is likewise quite Fichtian; in this case, however, it is from
a wider and more universal point of view, since the ego is
therein grasped as an original identity.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> We find, however,
a summary of the Fichtian principle and the Kantian mode
of presentation: “It is only by something being originally
set in opposition to the ego, and by the ego being itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
posited as the manifold (in time), that it is possible for the
ego to get beyond the unity which belongs to it of merely
being posited, and that, for example, it posits the same content
on more than one occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Schelling then passed
on to natural philosophy, adopted Kantian forms and reflective
determinations, such as those of repulsion and
attraction, from Kant’s “Metaphysics of Nature,” and likewise
dealt with quite empirical phenomena in expressions
taken from Kant. All his first works on this subject come
under this category, viz.: “Ideas towards a Philosophy of
Nature,” 1797; “On the World-Soul,” 1798, the second
edition of which possesses appendices which are entirely
inconsistent with what goes before. In the writings of
Herder and Kielmeyer<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> we find sensibility, irritability, and
reproduction dealt with, as also their laws, such as that
the greater the sensibility the less the irritability, &amp;c.—just
as the powers or potencies were dealt with by Eschenmayer.
It was only later on in relation to these that Schelling first
apprehended nature in the categories of thought, and made
general attempts of a more definite character in the direction
of greater scientific development. It was only through
what had been accomplished by these men that he was
enabled to come into public notice so young. The spiritual
and intellectual side, morality and the state, he represented
on the other hand purely in accordance with Kantian principles:
thus in his “Transcendental Idealism,” although it
was written from a Fichtian point of view, he goes no
further than Kant did in his “Philosophy of Rights” and
his work “On Eternal Peace.” Schelling, indeed, later on
published a separate treatise on Freedom, deeply speculative
in character; this, however, remains isolated and independent,
and deals with this one point alone; in Philosophy,
however, nothing isolated can be worked out or developed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
In the various presentations of his views Schelling on each
occasion began again from the beginning, because, as we
may see, what went before did not satisfy him; he has ever
pressed on to seek a new form, and thus he has tried various
forms and terminologies in succession without ever setting
forth one complete and consistent whole. His principal
works in this connection are the “First Sketch of a System
of Natural Philosophy,” 1799; the “System of Transcendental
Idealism,” 1800, one of his most carefully thought-out
works; “Bruno, a Dialogue on the Divine and Natural
Principle of Things,” 1802; “Journal of Speculative
Physics,” 1801; “New Journal of Speculative Physics,”
1802 <i>et</i> In the second number of the second volume of
his “Journal of Speculative Physics,” Schelling made the
commencement of a detailed treatment of the whole of his
philosophy. Here he likewise starts to a certain measure,
though unconsciously, from the Fichtian form of construction;
but the idea is already present that nature
equally with knowledge is a system of reason.</p>

<p>It is not feasible here to go into details respecting
what is called the philosophy of Schelling, even if time permitted.
For it is not yet a scientific whole organized in all
its branches, since it rather consists in certain general
elements which do not fluctuate with the rest of his opinions.
Schelling’s philosophy must still be regarded as in process
of evolution, and it has not yet ripened into fruit;<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> we can
hence give a general idea of it only.</p>

<p>When Schelling made his first appearance the demands
put forward by Philosophy were as follows. With Descartes
thought and extension were in some incomprehensible way
united in God, with Spinoza it was as motionless substance;
and beyond this point of view neither of them ever passed.
Later on we saw the form develop, partly in the sciences and
partly in the Kantian philosophy. Finally, in the Fichtian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
philosophy, the form was subjectivity on its own account,
from which all determinations were held to develop. What
is thus demanded is that this subjectivity of infinite form
which we saw dying into irony or arbitrariness (pp. 507-510)
should be delivered from its one-sidedness in order to
be united with objectivity and substantiality. To put it
otherwise, the substance of Spinoza should not be apprehended
as the unmoved, but as the intelligent, as a form
which possesses activity within itself of necessity, so that it
is the forming power of nature, but at the same time knowledge
and comprehension. This then is the object of Philosophy;
it is not the formal union of Spinoza that is
demanded, nor the subjective totality of Fichte, but totality
with the infinite form. We see this developing in the
philosophy of Schelling.</p>

<p>1. In one of his earlier writings, the “System of Transcendental
Idealism,” which we shall consider first of all,
Schelling represented transcendental philosophy and
natural philosophy as the two sides of scientific knowledge.
Respecting the nature of the two, he expressly declared
himself in this work, where he once more adopts a Fichtian
starting-point: “All knowledge rests on the harmony of
an objective with a subjective.” In the common sense of
the words this would be allowed; absolute unity, where
the Notion and the reality are undistinguished in the perfected
Idea, is the Absolute alone, or God; all else contains
an element of discord between the objective and subjective.
“We may give the name of nature to the entire
objective content of our knowledge; the entire subjective
content, on the other hand, is called the ego or intelligence.”
They are in themselves identical and presupposed
as identical. The relation of nature to intelligence is given
by Schelling thus: “Now if all knowledge has two poles
which mutually presuppose and demand one another, there
must be two fundamental sciences, and it must be impossible
to start from the one pole without being driven to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
other.” Thus nature is impelled to spirit, and spirit to
nature; either may be given the first place, and both must
come to pass. “If the objective is made the chief,” we
have the natural sciences as result, and “the necessary
tendency,” the end, “of all natural science thus is to pass
from nature to intelligence. This is the meaning of the
effort to connect natural phenomena with theory. The
highest perfection of natural science would be the perfect
spiritualization of all natural laws into laws of intuitive
perception and thought. The phenomenal (the material
element) must entirely disappear, and laws (the formal
element) alone remain. Hence it comes to pass that the
more that which is in conformity with law breaks forth in
nature itself, the more the outward covering disappears;
the phenomena themselves become more spiritual, and
finally cease altogether. The perfect theory of nature
would be that by which the whole of nature should be
resolved into an intelligence. The dead and unconscious
products of nature are only abortive attempts on the part
of nature to reflect itself, but the so-called dead nature is
really an immature,” torpid, fossilized “intelligence”; it
is implicit only, and thus remains in externality; “hence in
its phenomena,” even though “still unconsciously, the
character of intelligence shines through. Its highest end,
which is to become object to itself, is first attained by
nature” (instead of nature we should call it the Idea of
nature), “through its highest and ultimate reflection, which
is none other than man, or, more generally, it is that which
we call reason, through which nature for the first time
returns completely within itself, and whereby it becomes
evident that nature is originally identical with what is
known in us as intelligence or the conscious. Through
this tendency to make nature intelligent natural science
becomes the philosophy of nature.” The intelligent
character of nature is thus spoken of as a postulate of
science. The other point of view is “to give the subjective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
the foremost place.” Thus here “the problem is
how to add an objective element agreeing with it. To start
from the subjective as from the first and absolute, and to
make the objective arise from it,” signifies a new departure;
its consideration forms the content of true Transcendental
Philosophy, or, as Schelling himself now named this
science, “the other science fundamental to Philosophy.”
The organ of transcendental philosophy is the subjective,
the production of inward action. Production and reflection
upon this production, the unconscious and conscious in
one, is the æsthetic act of the imagination.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Thus these
two separate processes are as a whole very clearly expressed:
the process which leads from nature to the subject,
and that leading from the ego to the object. But the true
process could only be traced out by means of logic, for
it contains pure thoughts; but the logical point of view
was what Schelling never arrived at in his presentation of
things.</p>

<p>a. In respect of the ego, as principle of the transcendental
philosophy, Schelling sets to work in the same
way as did Fichte, inasmuch as he begins from the fact of
knowledge “in which the content is conditioned through
the form, and the form through the content”; this is formal
A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A. But does A exist? The ego is “the point where
subject and object are one in their unmediated condition”;
the ego is just Ego&nbsp;=&nbsp;Ego, subject-object; and that
is the act of self-consciousness wherein I am for myself
object to myself. In self-consciousness there is not to be
found a distinction between me and anything else; what
are distinguished are directly identical, and there is so far
nothing at all in opposition to this self-consciousness.
How the case stands with regard to external objects is the
question which must be decided later, in the further course
of development. It is only the Notion of the ego which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
to be laid hold of: “The Notion of the ego, that is the act
whereby thought in general becomes object to itself, and
the ego itself (the object) are absolutely one; independently
of this act the ego is nothing.” It is the act whereby
thought makes itself objective, and wherein the ego is
brought into harmony with the objective, with thought;
and from this standpoint it had to be demonstrated how
the ego makes its way to objectivity. “The ego, as pure
act, as pure action, is not objective in knowledge itself, for
the reason that it is the principle of all knowledge. If it
is to be object of knowledge, this must come to pass
through a very different kind of knowledge than the
ordinary.” The immediate consciousness of this identity
is intuition, but inwardly it becomes “intellectual intuition”;
it “is a knowledge which is the production of its
object: sensuous intuition or perception is perception of
such a nature that the perception itself appears to be different
from what is perceived. Now intellectual intuition is
the organ of all transcendental thought,” the act of pure
self-consciousness generally. “The ego is nothing else
than a process of production which ever makes itself its
own object. Science can start from nothing objective,”
but from “the non-objective which itself becomes object”
as an “original duplicity. Idealism is the mechanism of
the origination of the objective world from the inward
principle of spiritual activity.”<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>On the one hand Schelling’s system is related to the
philosophy of Fichte, and, on the other hand, he, like
Jacobi, makes his principle immediate knowledge—the intelligent
intuitive perception which all who wish to philosophize
must have. But what comes next is that its
content is no longer the indeterminate, the essence of
essence, but likewise the Absolute, God, the absolutely
self-existent, though expressed as concrete, <i>i.e.</i> as mediating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
itself within itself, as the absolute unity or indifference of
subjective and objective. Intellectual intuition is the
Fichtian imagination oscillating between two different
points. We have already spoken above (p. 417) of the <i>form</i>
of intellectual intuition; it is the most convenient manner
of asserting knowledge respecting—anything one likes.
But the immediate knowledge of God as spiritual is only
in the consciousness of Christian nations, and not for
others. This immediate knowledge appears to be still
more contingent as the intellectual intuition of the concrete,
or the identity of subjectivity and objectivity. This
intuition is intellectual indeed, because it is a rational
intuition, and as knowledge it is likewise absolutely one
with the object of knowledge. But this intuition, although
itself knowledge, is not as yet known; it is the unmediated,
the postulated. As it is in this way an immediate we
must possess it, and what may be possessed may likewise
not be possessed. Thus since the immediate presupposition
in Philosophy is that individuals have the immediate
intuition of this identity of subjective and objective, this
gave the philosophy of Schelling the appearance of indicating
that the presence of this intuition in individuals
demanded a special talent, genius, or condition of mind of
their own, or as though it were generally speaking an
accidental faculty which pertained to the specially favoured
few. For the immediate, the intuitively perceived, is in
the form of an existent, and is not thus an essential; and
whoever does not understand the intellectual intuition
must come to the conclusion that he does not possess it.
Or else, in order to understand it, men must give themselves
the trouble of possessing it; but no one can tell whether
he has it or not—not even from understanding it, for we
may merely think we understand it. Philosophy, however,
is in its own nature capable of being universal; for its
ground-work is thought, and it is through thought that
man is man. Schelling’s principle is thus indeed clearly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
universal; but if a definite intuition, a definite consciousness
is demanded, such as the consciousness or intuition of
the identity of subjective and objective, this determinate
particular thought is not as yet to be found in it.</p>

<p>It was, however, in this form of knowledge of the
absolute as concrete, and, further, in the form of unity of
subjective and objective, that Philosophy as represented by
Schelling more especially marked itself off from the
ordinary conceiving consciousness and its mode of reflection.
Even less than Fichte did Schelling attain to popularity
(<i>supra</i>, pp. 504, 505), for the concrete in its nature
is directly speculative. The concrete content, God, life, or
whatever particular form it has, is indeed the content and
object of natural consciousness; but the difficulty lies in
bringing what is contained in the concrete into concrete
thought in accordance with its different determinations,
and in laying hold of the unity. It pertains to the standpoint
of the understanding to divide and to distinguish,
and to maintain the finite thought-determinations in their
opposition; but Philosophy demands that these different
thoughts should be brought together. Thought begins by
holding apart infinite and finite, cause and effect, positive
and negative; since this is the region of reflecting consciousness,
the old metaphysical consciousness was able to
take part in so doing: but the speculative point of view is
to have this opposition before itself and to reconcile it.
With Schelling the speculative form has thus again come
to the front, and philosophy has again obtained a special
character of its own; the principle of Philosophy, rational
thought in itself, has obtained the form of thought. In
the philosophy of Schelling the content, the truth, has
once more become the matter of chief importance, whereas
in the Kantian philosophy the point of interest was more
especially stated to be the necessity for investigating subjective
knowledge. This is the standpoint of Schelling’s
philosophy in its general aspects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>b. Since in further analysis the distinction between subject
and object comes into view and is accepted, there
follows the relationship of the ego to its other; with Fichte
that forms the second proposition, in which the self-limitation
of the ego is posited. The ego posits itself in opposition
to itself, since it posits itself as conditioned by the
non-ego; that is the infinite repulsion, for this conditionment
is the ego itself. Schelling, on the one hand, says:
“The ego is unlimited as the ego only in so far as it is
limited,” as it relates to the non-ego. Only thus does
consciousness exist, self-consciousness is a barren determination;
through its intuition of self the ego becomes
finite to itself. “This contradiction only allows itself to
be dissolved by the ego becoming in this finitude infinite to
itself, <i>i.e.</i> by its having an intuitive perception of itself as
an infinite Becoming.” The relation of the ego to itself
and to the infinite check or force of repulsion is a constant
one. On the other hand it is said: “The ego is limited
only in so far as it is unlimited;” this limitation is thus
necessary in order to be able to get beyond it. The
contradiction which we find here remains even if the ego
always limits the non-ego. “Both activities—that which
makes for infinitude, the limitable, real, objective activity,
and the limiting and ideal, mutually presuppose one
another. Idealism reflects merely on the one, realism on
the other, transcendental idealism on both.”<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> All this is
a tangled mass of abstractions.</p>

<p>c. “Neither through the limiting activity nor through
the limited does the ego arrive at self-consciousness.
There consequently is a third activity, compounded from
the other two, through which the ego of self-consciousness
arises; this third is that which oscillates between the two—the
struggle between opposing tendencies.” There is
essential relation only, relative identity; the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
therein present thus ever remains. “This struggle cannot
be reconciled by one such action, but only by an infinite
succession of such,” <i>i.e.</i> the reconciliation of the opposition
between the two tendencies of the ego, the inward and the
outward, is, in the infinite course of progression, only an
apparent one. In order that it may be complete, the whole
inward and outward nature must be presented in all its
details: but Philosophy can only set forth the epochs
which are most important. “If all the intermediate links
in sensation could be set forth, that would necessarily lead
us to a deduction of all the qualities in nature, which last
is impossible.” Now this third activity, which contains the
union directly in itself, is a thought in which particularity
is already contained. It is the intuitive understanding of
Kant, the intelligent intuition or intuitively perceiving
intelligence; Schelling, indeed, definitely names this
absolute unity of contradictions intellectual intuition. The
ego here is not one-sided in regard to what is different;
it is identity of the unconscious and the conscious, but not
an identity of such a nature that its ground rests on the
ego itself.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>This ego must be the absolute principle: “All philosophy
starts from a principle which as absolute identity is non-objective.”
For if it is objective, separation is at once
posited and it is confronted by another; but the principle
is the reconciliation of the opposition, and therefore in and
for itself it is non-objective. “Now how should a principle
such as this be called forth to consciousness and understood,
as is required if it is the condition attached to the comprehension
of all philosophy? That it can no more be comprehended
through Notions [Begriffe] than set forth, requires
no proof.” Notion to Schelling signifies a category of the
ordinary understanding; Notion is, however, the concrete
thought which in itself is infinite. “There thus remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
nothing more than that it should be set forth in an
immediate intuition. If there were such an intuition which
had as object the absolutely identical, that which in itself
is neither subjective nor objective, and if for such, which,”
however, “can be an intellectual intuition only, one could
appeal to immediate experience,” the question would be:
“How can this intuition be again made objective, <i>i.e.</i> how
can it be asserted without doubt that it does not rest on a
subjective deception, if there is not a universal objectivity
in that intuition, which is recognized by all?” This intellectual
principle in itself should thus be given in an experience
so that men may be able to appeal to it. “The
objectivity of intellectual intuition is art. The work of
art alone reflects to me what is otherwise reflected through
nothing—that absolute identical which has already separated
itself in the ego itself.” The objectivity of identity and the
knowledge of the same is art; in one and the same intuition
the ego is here conscious of itself and unconscious.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
This intellectual intuition which has become objective is
objective sensuous intuition—but the Notion, the comprehended
necessity, is a very different objectivity.</p>

<p>Thus a principle is presupposed both for the content of
philosophy and for subjective philosophizing: on the one
hand it is demanded that the attitude adopted should be
one of intellectual intuition, and, on the other hand, this
principle has to be authenticated, and this takes place in
the work of art. This is the highest form of the objectivization
of reason, because in it sensuous conception is united
with intellectuality, sensuous existence is merely the expression
of spirituality. The highest objectivity which the
subject attains, the highest identity of subjective and
objective, is that which Schelling terms the power of
imagination. Art is thus comprehended as what is inmost
and highest, that which produces the intellectual and real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
in one, and philosophizing is conceived as this genius of
art. But art and power of imagination are not supreme.
For the Idea, spirit, cannot be truly given expression to
in the manner in which art expresses its Idea. This last
is always a method pertaining to intuitive perception; and
on account of this sensuous form of existence the work of
art cannot correspond to the spirit. Thus because the
point last arrived at is designated as the faculty of imagination,
as art, even in the subject this is a subordinate point
of view, and thus in itself this point is not the absolute
identity of subjectivity and objectivity. In subjective
thought, rational, speculative thought is thus indeed
demanded, but if this appears false to you nothing farther
can be said than that you do not possess intellectual intuition.
The proving of anything, the making it comprehensible,
is thus abandoned; a correct apprehension of it is directly
demanded, and the Idea is thus assertorically pre-established
as principle. The Absolute is the absolute identity of
subjective and objective, the absolute indifference of real and
ideal, of form and essence, of universal and particular; in
this identity of the two there is neither the one nor the
other. But the unity is not abstract, empty, and dry;
that would signify logical identity, classification according
to something common to both, in which the difference
remains all the while outside. The identity is concrete: it
is subjectivity as well as objectivity; the two are present
therein as abrogated and ideal. This identity may easily
be shown in the ordinary conception: the conception, we
may for example say, is subjective; it has, too, the determinate
content of exclusion in reference to other conceptions;
nevertheless, the conception is simple—it is one act,
one unity.</p>

<p>What is lacking in Schelling’s philosophy is thus the fact
that the point of indifference of subjectivity and objectivity,
or the Notion of reason, is absolutely presupposed, without
any attempt being made at showing that this is the truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
Schelling often uses Spinoza’s form of procedure, and
sets up axioms. In philosophy, when we desire to establish
a position, we demand proof. But if we begin with intellectual
intuition, that constitutes an oracle to which we have
to give way, since the existence of intellectual intuition was
made our postulate. The true proof that this identity of subjective
and objective is the truth, could only be brought
about by means of each of the two being investigated in
its logical, <i>i.e.</i> essential determinations; and in regard to
them, it must then be shown that the subjective signifies
the transformation of itself into the objective, and that the
objective signifies its not remaining such, but making
itself subjective. Similarly in the finite, it would have to
be shown that it contained a contradiction in itself, and
made itself infinite; in this way we should have the unity
of finite and infinite. In so doing, this unity of opposites is
not asserted beforehand, but in the opposites themselves it
is shown that their truth is their unity, but that each taken
by itself is one-sided—that their difference veers round,
casting itself headlong into this unity—while the understanding
all the time thinks that in these differences it
possesses something fixed and secure. The result of thinking
contemplation would in this former case be that each moment
would secretly make itself into its opposite, the identity of
both being alone the truth. The understanding certainly
calls this transformation sophistry, humbug, juggling, and
what-not. As a result, this identity would, according to
Jacobi, be one which was no doubt conditioned and of set
purpose produced. But we must remark that a one-sided
point of view is involved in apprehending the result of
development merely as a result; it is a process which is
likewise mediation within itself, of such a nature that this
mediation is again abrogated and asserted as immediate.
Schelling, indeed, had this conception in a general way,
but he did not follow it out in a definite logical method, for
with him it remained an immediate truth, which can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
be verified by means of intellectual intuition. That is the
great difficulty in the philosophy of Schelling. And then
it was misunderstood and all interest taken from it. It is
easy enough to show that subjective and objective are
different. Were they not different, nothing could be made
of them any more than of A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A; but they are in opposition
<i>as one</i>. In all that is finite, an identity is present, and this
alone is actual; but besides the fact that the finite is this
identity, it is also true that it is the absence of harmony
between subjectivity and objectivity, Notion and reality; and
it is in this that finitude consists. To this principle of Schelling’s,
form, or necessity, is thus lacking, it is only asserted.
Schelling appears to have this in common with Plato and the
Neo-Platonists, that knowledge is to be found in the inward
intuition of eternal Ideas wherein knowledge is unmediated
in the Absolute. But when Plato speaks of this intuition
of the soul, which has freed itself from all knowledge that
is finite, empirical, or reflected, and the Neo-Platonists tell
of the ecstasy of thought in which knowledge is the
immediate knowledge of the Absolute, this definite distinction
must be noticed, viz., that with Plato’s knowledge
of the universal, or with his intellectuality, wherein
all opposition as a reality is abrogated, dialectic is
associated, or the recognized necessity for the abrogation
of these opposites; Plato does not begin with this, for with
him the movement in which they abrogate themselves is
present. The Absolute is itself to be looked at as this
movement of self-abrogation; this is the only actual knowledge
and knowledge of the Absolute. With Schelling this
idea has, however, no dialectic present in it whereby those
opposites may determine themselves to pass over into their
unity, and in so doing to be comprehended.</p>

<p>2. Schelling begins with the idea of the Absolute as
identity of the subjective and objective, and accordingly
there evinced itself in the presentations of his system
which followed, the further necessity of proving this idea;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
this he attempted to do in the two Journals of Speculative
Physics. But if that method be once adopted, the procedure
is not immanent development from the speculative Idea,
but it follows the mode of external reflection. Schelling’s
proofs are adduced in such an exceedingly formal manner
that they really invariably presuppose the very thing that
was to be proved. The axiom assumes the main point in
question, and all the rest follows as a matter of course. Here
is an instance: “The innermost essence of the Absolute can
only be thought of as identity absolute, altogether pure and
undisturbed. For the Absolute is only absolute, and what is
thought in it is necessarily and invariably the same, or in
other words, is necessarily and invariably absolute. If the
idea of the Absolute were a general Notion” (or conception),
“this would not prevent a difference being met with
in it, notwithstanding this unity of the absolute. For
things the most different are yet in the Notion always one
and identical, just as a rectangle, a polygon and a circle are
all figures. The possibility of the difference of all things in
association with perfect unity in the Notion lies in the
manner in which the particular in them is combined with
the universal. In the Absolute this altogether disappears,
because it pertains to the very idea of the Absolute that
the particular in it is also the universal, and the universal
the particular; and further that by means of this unity
form and existence are also one in it. Consequently, in
regard to the Absolute, from the fact of its being the
Absolute, there likewise follows the absolute exclusion from
its existence of all difference, and that at once.”<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>In the former of the two above-named works, the
“Journal of Speculative Physics,” Schelling began by
again bringing forward the Substance of Spinoza, simple,
absolute Existence, inasmuch as he makes his starting-point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
the absolute identity of the subjective and objective.
Here, like Spinoza, he employed the method of geometry,
laying down axioms and proving by means of propositions,
then going on to deduce other propositions from these, and
so on. But this method has no real application to
philosophy. Schelling at this point laid down certain
forms of difference, to which he gave the name of potencies,
adopting the term from Eschenmayer, who made use of
it (p. 514);<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> they are ready-made differences, which
Schelling avails himself of. But philosophy must not take
any forms from other sciences, as here from mathematics.
With Schelling, the leading form is that which was brought
into remembrance again by Kant, the form of triplicity
as first, second, and third potency.</p>

<p>Schelling, like Fichte, begins with I&nbsp;=&nbsp;I, or with the
absolute intuition, expressed as proposition or definition of
the Absolute, that “Reason is the absolute indifference of
subject and object”: so that it is neither the one nor the
other, for both have in it their true determination; and
their opposition, like all others, is utterly done away with.
The true reality of subject and object is placed in this
alone, that the subject is not posited in the determination
of subject against object, as in the philosophy of Fichte; it
is not determined as in itself existent, but as subject-object,
as the identity of the two; in the same way the object is
not posited according to its ideal determination as object,
but in as far as it is itself absolute, or the identity of the
subjective and objective. But the expression “indifference”
is ambiguous, for it means indifference in regard to
both the one and the other; and thus it appears as if the
content of indifference, the only thing which makes it concrete,
were indifferent. Schelling’s next requirement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
that the subject must not be hampered with reflection; that
would be bringing it under the determination of the understanding,
which, equally with sensuous perception, implies
the separateness of sensuous things. As to the form of
its existence, absolute indifference is with Schelling posited
as A&nbsp;=&nbsp;A; and this form is for him the knowledge of absolute
identity, which, however, is inseparable from the Being or
existence of the same.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>Thus, therefore, opposition, as form and reality or existence,
no doubt appears in this Absolute, but it is determined
as a merely relative or unessential opposition: “Between
subject and object no other than quantitative difference is
possible. For no qualitative difference as regards the two
is thinkable,” because absolute identity “is posited as
subject and object only as regards the form of its Being,
not as regards its existence. There is consequently only a
quantitative difference left,” <i>i.e.</i> only that of magnitude:
and yet difference must really be understood as qualitative,
and must thus be shown to be a difference which abrogates
itself. This quantitative difference, says Schelling, is the
form <i>actu</i>: “The quantitative difference of subjective and
objective is the basis of all finitude. Each determined
potency marks a determined quantitative difference of the
subjective and objective. Each individual Being is the
result of a quantitative difference of subjectivity and
objectivity. The individual expresses absolute identity
under a determined form of Being:” so that each side is
itself a relative totality, A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B, and at the same time the
one factor preponderates in the one, and the other factor in
the other, but both remain absolute identity.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> This is
insufficient, for there are other determinations; difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
is undoubtedly qualitative, although this is not the absolute
determination. Quantitative difference is no true difference,
but an entirely external relation; and likewise the preponderance
of subjective and objective is not a determination
of thought, but a merely sensuous determination.</p>

<p>The Absolute itself, in so far as the positing of difference
is taken into account, is defined by Schelling as the quantitative
indifference of subjective and objective: in respect
to absolute identity no quantitative difference is thinkable.
“Quantitative difference is only possible outside of absolute
identity, and outside of absolute totality. There is nothing
in itself outside of totality, excepting by virtue of an arbitrary
separation of the individual from the whole. Absolute
identity exists only under the form of the quantitative
indifference of subjective and objective.” Quantitative
difference, which appears outside of absolute identity and
totality, is therefore, according to Schelling, in itself absolute
identity, and consequently thinkable only under the
form of the quantitative indifference of the subjective and
objective. “This opposition does not therefore occur in
itself, or from the standpoint of speculation. From this
standpoint A exists just as much as B does; for A like B
is the whole absolute identity, which only exists under the
two forms, but under both of them alike. Absolute identity
is the universe itself. The form of its Being can be thought
of under the image of a line,” as shown by the following
scheme:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/equation.jpg" width="300" height="105"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">“in which the same identity is posited in each direction,
but with A or B preponderating in opposite directions.”<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
If we go into details, the main points from an elementary
point of view are the following.</p>

<p>The first potency is that the first quantitative difference
of the Absolute, or “the first relative totality is matter.
Proof: A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B is not anything real either as relative identity
or as relative duplicity. As identity A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B, in the individual
as in the whole, can be expressed only by the line,”—the
first dimension. “But in that line A is posited
throughout as existent,” <i>i.e.</i> it is at the same time related
to B. “Therefore this line presupposes A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B as relative
totality throughout; relative totality is therefore the first
presupposition, and if relative identity exists, it exists only
through relative totality,”—this is duplicity, the second
dimension. “In the same way relative duplicity presupposes
relative identity. Relative identity and duplicity are
contained in relative totality, not indeed <i>actu</i>, but yet
<i>potentia</i>. Therefore the two opposites must mutually extinguish
each other in a third” dimension. “Absolute
identity as the immediate basis of the reality of A and B
in matter, is the force of gravitation. If A preponderates
we have the force of attraction, if B preponderates we have
that of expansion. The quantitative positing of the forces
of attraction and expansion passes into the infinite; their
equilibrium exists in the whole, not in the individual.”<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
From matter as the first indifference in immediacy
Schelling now passes on to further determinations.</p>

<p>The second potency (A²) is light, this identity itself
posited as existent; in so far as A&nbsp;=&nbsp;B, A² is also posited.
The same identity, “posited under the form of relative
identity,” <i>i.e.</i> of the polarity which we find appearing “in A
and B, is the force of cohesion. Cohesion is the impression
made on matter by the self-hood” of light “or by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
personality, whereby matter first emerges as particular out
of the universal identity, and raises itself into the realm of
form.” Planets, metals and other bodies form a series
which under the form of dynamic cohesion expresses particular
relations of cohesion, in which on the one hand
contraction preponderates, and on the other hand expansion.
These potencies appear with Schelling as north and
south, east and west polarity: their developments further
appear as north-west, south-east, &amp;c. He counts as the
last potency Mercury, Venus, the Earth, &amp;c. He continues:
“Cohesion outside of the point of indifference I
term passive. Towards the negative side” (or pole) “fall
some of the metals which stand next to iron, after them
the so-called precious metals,” then the “diamond, and
lastly carbon, the greatest passive cohesion. Towards
the positive side, again, some metals fall, in which the
cohesive nature of iron gradually diminishes,” <i>i.e.</i> approaches
disintegration, and lastly “disappears in nitrogen.”
Active cohesion is magnetism, and the material
universe is an infinite magnet. The magnetic
process is difference in indifference, and indifference
in difference, and therefore absolute identity as
such. The indifference point of the magnet is the
“neither nor” and the “as well as”; the poles are
potentially the same essence, only posited under two
factors which are opposed. Both poles depend “only
upon whether + or - preponderates”; they are not pure
abstractions. “In the total magnet the empirical magnet
is the indifference point. The empirical magnet is iron. All
bodies are mere metamorphoses of iron—they are potentially
contained in iron. Every two different bodies which touch
each other set up mutually in each other relative diminution
and increase of cohesion. This mutual alteration of
cohesion by means of the contact of two different bodies is
electricity; the cohesion-diminishing factor +E is the
potency of hydrogen,-E is the potency of oxygen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
The totality of the dynamic process is represented only
by the chemical process.”<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>“By the positing of the dynamic totality the addition of
light is directly posited as a product. The expression,
the total product, therefore signifies light combined with
the force of gravitation; by the positing of the relative
totality of the whole potency, the force of gravity is directly
reduced to the mere form of the Being of absolute identity.”
Thus is the third potency (A³), the organism.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Schelling
launched out into too many individual details, if he desired to
indicate the construction of the whole universe. On the one
hand, however, he did not complete this representation, and
on the other hand, he has confined himself mainly to implicit
existence, and has mixed therewith the formalism of
external construction according to a presupposed scheme.
In this representation he advanced only as far as the
organism, and did not reach the presentation of the other
side of knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> the philosophy of spirit. Schelling
began time after time, in accordance with the idea
implied in this construction, to work out the natural
universe, and especially the organism. He banishes all
such meaningless terms as perfection, wisdom, outward
adaptability; or, in other words, the Kantian formula, that
a thing appears so and so to our faculty of knowledge, is
transformed by him into this other formula, that such and
such is the constitution of Nature. Following up Kant’s
meagre attempt at demonstrating spirit in nature, he
devoted special attention to inaugurating anew this mode
of regarding nature, so as to recognize in objective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
existence the same schematism, the same rhythm, as is
present in the ideal. Hence nature represents itself
therein not as something alien to spirit, but as being in its
general aspect a projection of spirit into an objective mode.</p>

<p>We have further to remark that Schelling by this theory
became the originator of modern Natural Philosophy, since
he was the first to exhibit Nature as the sensuous perception
or the expression of the Notion and its determinations.
Natural Philosophy is no new science; we met
with it continually—in the works of Aristotle, for instance,
and elsewhere. English Philosophy is also a mere apprehension
in thought of the physical; forces, laws of Nature,
are its fundamental determinations. The opposition of
physics and Natural Philosophy is therefore not the
opposition of the unthinking and the thinking view of
Nature; Natural Philosophy means, if we take it in its
whole extent, nothing else than the thoughtful contemplation
of Nature; but this is the work of ordinary physics
also, since its determinations of forces, laws, &amp;c., are
thoughts. The only difference is that in physics thoughts
are formal thoughts of the understanding, whose material
and content cannot, as regards their details, be determined
by thought itself, but must be taken from experience.
But concrete thought contains its determination and its
content in itself, and merely the external mode of appearance
pertains to the senses. If, then, Philosophy passes
beyond the form of the understanding, and has apprehended
the speculative Notion, it must alter the determinations of
thought, the categories of the understanding regarding
Nature. Kant was the first to set about this; and Schelling
has sought to grasp the Notion of Nature, instead of
contenting himself with the ordinary metaphysics of the
same. Nature is to him nothing but the external mode
of existence as regards the system of thought-forms,
just as mind is the existence of the same system in the
form of consciousness. That for which we have to thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
Schelling, therefore, is not that he brought thought to
bear on the comprehension of Nature, but that he
altered the categories according to which thought applied
itself to Nature; he introduced forms of Reason, and
applied them—as he did the form of the syllogism in
magnetism, for instance—in place of the ordinary categories
of the understanding. He has not only shown these forms
in Nature, but has also sought to evolve Nature out of a
principle of this kind.</p>

<p>In the “Further Exposition of the System of Philosophy”
which the “New Journal for Speculative Physics” furnishes,
Schelling chose other forms; for, by reason of
incompletely developed form and lack of dialectic, he had
recourse to various forms one after another, because he
found none of them sufficient. Instead of the equilibrium
of subjectivity and objectivity, he now speaks of the
identity of existence and form, of universal and particular,
of finite and infinite, of positive and negative, and he
defines absolute indifference sometimes in one and sometimes
in another form of opposition, just according to
chance. All such oppositions may be employed; but they
are only abstract, and refer to different stages in the
development of the logical principle itself. Form and
essence are distinguished by Schelling in this way, that
form, regarded on its own account, is the particular, or the
emerging of difference, subjectivity. But real existence is
absolute form or absolute knowledge immediately in itself,
a self-conscious existence in the sense of thinking knowledge,
just as with Spinoza it had the form of something
objective or in thought. Speculative Philosophy is to be
found in this assertion, not that it asserts an independent
philosophy, for it is purely organization; knowledge
is based on the Absolute. Thus Schelling has again
given to transcendental Idealism the significance of absolute
Idealism. This unity of existence and form is thus,
according to Schelling, the Absolute; or if we regard
reality as the universal, and form as the particular, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
Absolute is the absolute unity of universal and particular,
or of Being and knowledge. The different aspects, subject
and object, or universal and particular, are only ideal
oppositions; they are in the Absolute entirely and altogether
one. This unity as form is intellectual intuition,
which posits Thinking and Being as absolutely alike, and
as it formally expresses the Absolute, it becomes at the same
time the expression of its essence. He who has not the
power of imagination, whereby he may represent this unity
to himself, is deficient in the organ of Philosophy. But in
this consists the true absoluteness of all and each, that the
one is not recognized as universal, and the other as particular,
but the universal in this its determination is
recognized as unity of the universal and particular, and in
like manner the particular is recognized as the unity of
both. Construction merely consists in leading back everything
determined and particular into the Absolute, or regarding
it as it is in absolute unity; its determinateness is
only its ideal moment, but its truth is really its Being in the
Absolute. These three moments or potencies—that of the
passing of existence (the infinite) into form (the finite),
and of form into existence (which are both relative unities),
and the third, the absolute unity, thus recur anew in each
individual. Hence Nature, the real or actual aspect, as
the passing of existence into form or of the universal into
the particular, itself again possesses these three unities in
itself, and in the same way the ideal aspect does so;
therefore each potency is on its own account once more
absolute. This is the general idea of the scientific construction
of the universe—to repeat in each individual
alike the triplicity which is the scheme of the whole, thereby
to show the identity of all things, and in doing so to
regard them in their absolute essence, so that they all
express the same unity.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The more detailed explanation is extremely formal:
“Existence passes into form—this taken by itself being the
particular (the finite)—by means of the infinite being added
to it; unity is received into multiplicity, indifference into
difference.” The other assertion is: “Form passes into
existence by the finite being received into the infinite,
difference into indifference.” But passing into and receiving
into are merely sensuous expressions. “Otherwise
expressed, the particular becomes absolute form by the
universal becoming one with it, and the universal becomes
absolute existence by the particular becoming one with it.
But these two unities, as in the Absolute, are not outside of
one another, but in one another, and therefore the Absolute
is absolute indifference of form and existence,” as unity of
this double passing-into-one. “By means of these two
unities two different potencies are determined, but in
themselves they are both the exactly equal roots of the
Absolute.”<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> That is a mere assertion, the continual return
after each differentiation, which is perpetually again removed
out of the Absolute.</p>

<p>“Of the first absolute transformation there are copies in
phenomenal Nature; therefore Nature, regarded in itself, is
nothing else than that first transformation as it exists in
the absolute (unseparated from the other). For by means
of the infinite passing into the finite, existence passes into
form; since then form obtains reality only by means of
existence, existence, when it has passed into form without
form having (according to the assumption) similarly passed
into existence, can be represented only as potentiality or
ground of reality, but not as indifference of possibility and
actuality. But that which may be described thus, namely
as existence, in so far as that is mere ground of reality, and
therefore has really passed into form, although form has not
in turn passed into it, is what presents itself as Nature.—Existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
makes its appearance in form, but in return form
also makes its appearance in existence; this is the other
unity,” that of mind. “This unity is established by the
finite being received into the infinite. At this point form,
as the particular, strikes into existence, and itself becomes
absolute. Form which passes into existence places itself
as absolute activity and positive cause of reality in opposition
to the existence which passes into form, and which
appears only as ground. The passing of absolute form into
existence is what we think of as God, and the images or
copies of this transformation are in the ideal world, which
is therefore in its implicitude the other unity.”<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Each of
these two transformations, then, is the whole totality, not,
however, posited and not appearing as totality, but with the
one or the other factor preponderating; each of the two
spheres has, therefore, in itself again these differences, and
thus in each of them the three potencies are to be found.</p>

<p>The ground or basis, Nature as basis merely, is matter,
gravity, as the first potency; this passing of form into
existence is in the actual world universal mechanism,
necessity. But the second potency is “the light which
shineth in darkness, form which has passed into existence.
The absolute unification of the two unities in actuality, so
that matter is altogether form, and form is altogether
matter, is organism, the highest expression of Nature as
it is in God, and of God as He is in Nature, in the finite.”
On the ideal side “Knowledge is the essence of the
Absolute brought into the daylight of form; action is a
transformation of form, as the particular, into the essence
of the Absolute. As in the real world form that is identified
with essence appears as light, so in the ideal world
God Himself appears in particular manifestation as the
living form which has emerged in the passing of form into
essence, so that in every respect the ideal and real world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
are again related as likeness and symbol. The absolute
unification of the two unities in the ideal, so that material
is wholly form and form wholly material, is the work of
art; and that secret hidden in the Absolute which is the
root of all reality comes here into view, in the reflected
world itself, in the highest potency and highest union of
God and Nature as the power of imagination.” On
account of that permeation art and poetry therefore hold
the highest rank in Schelling’s estimation. But art is the
Absolute in sensuous form alone. Where and what could
the work of art be, which should correspond to the Idea of
the spirit? “The universe is formed in the Absolute as the
most perfect organic existence and the most perfect work
of art: for Reason, which recognizes the Absolute in it, it
possesses absolute truth; for the imagination, which represents
the Absolute in it, it possesses absolute Beauty.
Each of these expresses the very same unity,” regarded
“from different sides; and both arrive at the absolute indifference
point in the recognition of which lies both the
beginning and the aim of real knowledge.”<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> This highest
Idea, these differences, are grasped as a whole in a very
formal manner only.</p>

<p>3. The relation of Nature to Spirit, and to God, the
Absolute, has been stated by Schelling elsewhere, <i>i.e.</i> in
his later expositions, as follows: he defines the existence
of God as Nature—in so far as God constitutes Himself its
ground or basis, as infinite perception—and Nature is thus
the negative moment in God, since intelligence and thought
exist only by means of the opposition of one Being. For
in one of his writings, directed on some particular occasion
against Jacobi, Schelling explains himself further with
regard to the nature of God and His relation to Nature.
He says: “God, or more properly the existence which is
God, is ground: He is ground of Himself as a moral Being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
But” then “it is ground that He makes Himself”—not
cause. Something must precede intelligence, and that
something is Being—“since thought is the exact opposite
of Being. That which is the beginning of an intelligence
cannot be in its turn intelligent, since there would otherwise
be no distinction; but it cannot be absolutely unintelligent,
for the very reason that it is the potentiality of an
intelligence. It will accordingly be something between
these, <i>i.e.</i> it will operate with wisdom, but as it were with
an innate, instinctive, blind, and yet unconscious wisdom;
just as we often hear those who are under a spell uttering
words full of understanding, but not uttering them with
comprehension of their meaning, but as it were owing to
an inspiration.” God, therefore, as this ground of Himself,
is Nature—Nature as it is in God; this is the view taken
of Nature in Natural Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But the work of the
Absolute is to abrogate this ground, and to constitute itself
Intelligence. On this account Schelling’s philosophy has
later been termed a Philosophy of Nature, and that in
the sense of a universal philosophy, while at first Natural
Philosophy was held to be only a part of the whole.</p>

<p>It is not incumbent on us here to give a more detailed
account of Schelling’s philosophy, or to show points in
the expositions hitherto given by him which are far from
satisfactory. The system is the latest form of Philosophy
which we had to consider, and it is a form both interesting
and true. In the first place special emphasis, in dealing
with Schelling, must be laid on the idea that he has
grasped the true as the concrete, as the unity of subjective
and objective. The main point in Schelling’s philosophy
thus is that its interest centres round that deep, speculative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
content, which, as content, is the content with which
Philosophy in the entire course of its history has had to do.
The Thought which is free and independent, not abstract,
but in itself concrete, comprehends itself in itself as an
intellectually actual world; and this is the truth of Nature,
Nature in itself. The second great merit possessed by
Schelling is to have pointed out in Nature the forms of
Spirit; thus electricity, magnetism, &amp;c., are for him only
external modes of the Idea. His defect is that this Idea
in general, its distinction into the ideal and the natural
world, and also the totality of these determinations, are not
shown forth and developed as necessitated in themselves by
the Notion. As Schelling has not risen to this point of
view, he has misconceived the nature of thought; the work
of art thus becomes for him the supreme and only mode in
which the Idea exists for spirit. But the supreme mode of
the Idea is really its own element; thought, the Idea
apprehended, is therefore higher than the work of art.
The Idea is the truth, and all that is true is the Idea; the
systematizing of the Idea into the world must be proved
to be a necessary unveiling and revelation. With Schelling,
on the other hand, form is really an external scheme, and
his method is the artificial application of this scheme
to external objects. This externally applied scheme takes
the place of dialectic progress; and this is the special
reason why the philosophy of Nature has brought itself
into discredit, that it has proceeded on an altogether
external plan, has made its foundation a ready-made
scheme, and fitted into it Nature as we perceive it. These
forms were potencies with Schelling, but instead of mathematical
forms or a type of thought like this, by some other
men sensuous forms have been taken as basis, just as were
sulphur and mercury by Jacob Boehme. For instance,
magnetism, electricity, and chemistry have been defined
to be the three potencies in Nature, and thus in the
organism reproduction has been termed chemistry;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
irritability, electricity; and sensibility, magnetism.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> In
this way there has crept into Natural Philosophy the
great formalism of representing everything as a series,
which is a superficial determination without necessity, since
instead of Notions we find formulas. Brilliant powers of
imagination are displayed, such as were exhibited by
Görres. This mistake of applying forms which are taken
from one sphere of Nature to another sphere of the same
has been carried a long way; Oken, for example, calls
wood-fibres the nerves and brain of the plant, and is almost
crazy on the subject. Philosophy would in this way
become a play of mere analogical reflections; and it is not
with these but with thoughts that we have to do. Nerves are
not thoughts, any more than such expressions as pole of
contraction, of expansion, masculine, feminine, &amp;c. The
formal plan of applying an external scheme to the sphere
of Nature which one wishes to observe, is the external
work of Natural Philosophy, and this scheme is itself
derived from the imagination. That is a most false mode
of proceeding; Schelling took advantage of it to some
extent, others have made a complete misuse of it. All
this is done to escape thought; nevertheless, thought is
the ultimate simple determination which has to be dealt
with.</p>

<p>It is therefore of the greatest importance to distinguish
Schelling’s philosophy, on the one hand, from that imitation
of it which throws itself into an unspiritual farrago of words
regarding the Absolute; and, on the other hand, from the
philosophy of those imitators, who, owing to a failure
to understand intellectual intuition, give up comprehension,
and with it the leading moment of knowledge, and speak
from so-called intuition, <i>i.e.</i> they take a glance at the thing
in question, and having fastened on it some superficial
analogy or definition, they fancy they have expressed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
whole nature, while in point of fact they put an end to
all capacity for attaining to scientific knowledge. This
whole tendency places itself, in the first place, in opposition
to reflective thought, or to progress in fixed, steadfast,
immovable Notions. But instead of remaining in
the Notion and recognizing it as the unresting ego, they
have lighted on the opposite extreme of passive intuition,
of immediate Being, of fixed implicitude; and they think
that they can make up for the lack of fixity by superficial
observation, and can render this observation intellectual
by determining it once more by some fixed Notion or
other; or they bring their minds to bear on the object of
consideration by saying, for instance, that the ostrich is
the fish among birds, because he has a long neck—fish
becomes a general term, but not a Notion. This whole
mode of reasoning, which has forced its way into natural
history and natural science, as well as into medicine, is a
miserable formalism, an irrational medley of the crudest
empiricism with the most superficial ideal determinations
that formalism ever descended to. The philosophy of
Locke is not so crude as it is, for it is not a whit better
in either its content or its form, and it is combined with
foolish self-conceit into the bargain. Philosophy on this
account sank into general and well-deserved contempt, such
as is for the most part extended to those who assert that they
have a monopoly of philosophy. Instead of earnestness of
apprehension and circumspection of thought, we find in
them a juggling with idle fancies, which pass for deep conceptions,
lofty surmises, and even for poetry; and they
think they are right in the centre of things when they are
only on the surface. Five-and-twenty years ago<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> the
case was the same with poetic art; a taste for ingenious
conceits took possession of it, and the effusions of its
poetic inspiration came forth blindly from itself, shot out as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
from a pistol. The results were either crazy ravings, or,
if they were not ravings, they were prose so dull that it
was unworthy of the name of prose. It is just the same
in the later philosophies. What is not utterly senseless
drivel about the indifference-point and polarity, about
oxygen, the holy, the infinite, &amp;c., is made up of thoughts
so trivial that we might well doubt our having correctly
apprehended their meaning, in the first place because they
are given forth with such arrogant effrontery, and in the
second place because we cannot help trusting that what
was said was not so trivial as it seems. As in the
Philosophy of Nature men forgot the Notion and proceeded
in a dead unspiritual course, so here they lose sight
of spirit entirely. They have strayed from the right road;
for by their principle, Notion and perception are one unity,
but in point of fact this unity, this spirit, itself emerges
in immediacy, and is therefore in intuitive perception, and
not in the Notion.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a id="c545">E. <span class="smcap">Final Result.</span></a></h2>

<p>The present standpoint of philosophy is that the Idea is
known in its necessity; the sides of its diremption, Nature
and Spirit, are each of them recognized as representing the
totality of the Idea, and not only as being in themselves identical,
but as producing this one identity from themselves; and
in this way the identity is recognized as necessary. Nature,
and the world or history of spirit, are the two realities;
what exists as actual Nature is an image of divine Reason;
the forms of self-conscious Reason are also the forms of
Nature. The ultimate aim and business of philosophy is to
reconcile thought or the Notion with reality. It is easy
from subordinate standpoints to find satisfaction in modes
of intuitive perception and of feeling. But the deeper the
spirit goes within itself, the more vehement is the opposition,
the more abundant is the wealth without; the depth is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
measured by the greatness of the craving with which spirit
seeks to find itself in what lies outside of itself. We saw
the thought which apprehends itself appearing; it strove
to make itself concrete within itself. Its first activity is
formal; Aristotle was the first to say that νοῦς is the thought
of thought. The result is the thought which is at home with
itself, and at the same time embraces the universe therein,
and transforms it into an intelligent world. In apprehension
the spiritual and the natural universe are interpenetrated
as one harmonious universe, which withdraws
into itself, and in its various aspects develops the
Absolute into a totality, in order, by the very process of
so doing, to become conscious of itself in its unity, in
Thought. Philosophy is thus the true theodicy, as contrasted
with art and religion and the feelings which these
call up—a reconciliation of spirit, namely of the spirit which
has apprehended itself in its freedom and in the riches of
its reality.</p>

<p>To this point the World-spirit has come, and each stage
has its own form in the true system of Philosophy; nothing
is lost, all principles are preserved, since Philosophy
in its final aspect is the totality of forms. This concrete
idea is the result of the strivings of spirit during almost
twenty-five centuries of earnest work to become objective
to itself, to know itself:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1"><i>Tantæ molis erat, se ipsam cognoscere mentem.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">All this time was required to produce the philosophy of our
day; so tardily and slowly did the World-spirit work to reach
this goal. What we pass in rapid review when we recall
it, stretched itself out in reality to this great length of
time. For in this lengthened period, the Notion of Spirit,
invested with its entire concrete development, its external
subsistence, its wealth, is striving to bring spirit to perfection,
to make progress itself and to develop from spirit.
It goes ever on and on, because spirit is progress alone.
Spirit often seems to have forgotten and lost itself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
inwardly opposed to itself, it is inwardly working ever forward
(as when Hamlet says of the ghost of his father, “Well
said, old mole! canst work i’ the ground so fast?”<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>), until
grown strong in itself it bursts asunder the crust of
earth which divided it from the sun, its Notion, so that the
earth crumbles away. At such a time, when the encircling
crust, like a soulless decaying tenement, crumbles away,
and spirit displays itself arrayed in new youth, the seven
league boots are at length adopted. This work of the
spirit to know itself, this activity to find itself, is the life of
the spirit and the spirit itself. Its result is the Notion
which it takes up of itself; the history of Philosophy is a
revelation of what has been the aim of spirit throughout
its history; it is therefore the world’s history in its innermost
signification. This work of the human spirit in the
recesses of thought is parallel with all the stages of reality;
and therefore no philosophy oversteps its own time. The
importance which the determinations of thought possessed
is another matter, which does not belong to the history
of Philosophy. These Notions are the simplest revelation
of the World spirit: in their more concrete form they are
history.</p>

<p>We must, therefore, in the first place not esteem lightly
what spirit has won, namely its gains up to the present
day. Ancient Philosophy is to be reverenced as necessary,
and as a link in this sacred chain, but all the same nothing
more than a link. The present is the highest stage reached.
In the second place, all the various philosophies are no
mere fashionable theories of the time, or anything of a
similar nature; they are neither chance products nor the
blaze of a fire of straw, nor casual eruptions here and there,
but a spiritual, reasonable, forward advance; they are of
necessity one Philosophy in its development, the revelation
of God, as He knows Himself to be. Where several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
philosophies appear at the same time, they are different
sides which make up one totality forming their basis; and
on account of their one-sidedness we see the refutation of
the one by the other. In the third place we do not find
here feeble little efforts to establish or to criticize this or
that particular point; instead of that, each philosophy
sets up a new principle of its own, and this must be
recognized.</p>

<p>If we glance at the main epochs in the whole history of
Philosophy, and grasp the necessary succession of stages in
the leading moments, each of which expresses a determinate
Idea, we find that after the Oriental whirl of subjectivity,
which attains to no intelligibility and therefore to no
subsistence, the light of thought dawned among the
Greeks.</p>

<p>1. The philosophy of the ancients had the absolute Idea
as its thought; and the realization or reality of the same
consisted in comprehending the existing present world, and
regarding it as it is in its absolute nature. This philosophy
did not make its starting-point the Idea itself, but proceeded
from the objective as from something given, and
transformed the same into the Idea; the Being of
Parmenides.</p>

<p>2. Abstract thought, νοῦς, became known to itself as
universal essence or existence, not as subjective thought;
the Universal of Plato.</p>

<p>3. In Aristotle the Notion emerges, free and unconstrained,
as comprehending thought, permeating and
spiritualizing all the forms which the universe contains.</p>

<p>4. The Notion as subject, its independence, its inwardness,
abstract separation, is represented by the Stoics,
Epicureans and Sceptics: here we have not the free,
concrete form, but universality abstract and in itself
formal.</p>

<p>5. The thought of totality, the intelligible world, is the
concrete Idea as we have seen it with the Neo-Platonists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
This principle is ideality generally speaking, which is
present in all reality, but not the Idea which knows itself:
this is not reached until the principle of subjectivity, individuality,
found a place in it, and God as spirit became
actual to Himself in self-consciousness.</p>

<p>6. But it has been the work of modern times to grasp
this Idea as spirit, as the Idea that knows itself. In order
to proceed from the conscious Idea to the self-conscious, we
must have the infinite opposition, namely the fact that the
Idea has come to the consciousness of being absolutely
sundered in twain. As spirit had the thought of objective
existence, Philosophy thus perfected the intellectuality of
the world, and produced this spiritual world as an object
existing beyond present reality, like Nature,—the first
creation of spirit. The work of the spirit now consisted in
bringing this Beyond back to reality, and guiding it into
self-consciousness. This is accomplished by self-consciousness
thinking itself, and recognizing absolute existence to
be the self-consciousness that thinks itself. With Descartes
pure thought directed itself on that separation which we
spoke of above. Self-consciousness, in the first place,
thinks of itself as consciousness; therein is contained all
objective reality, and the positive, intuitive reference of its
reality to the other side. With Spinoza Thought and Being
are opposed and yet identical; he has the intuitive perception
of substance, but the knowledge of substance in his
case is external. We have here the principle of reconciliation
taking its rise from thought as such, in order to abrogate
the subjectivity of thought: this is the case in Leibnitz’s
monad, which possesses the power of representation.</p>

<p>7. In the second place, self-consciousness thinks of itself
as being self-consciousness; in being self-conscious it is
independent, but still in this independence it has a negative
relation to what is outside self-consciousness. This is
infinite subjectivity, which appears at one time as the
critique of thought in the case of Kant, and at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
time, in the case of Fichte, as the tendency or impulse
towards the concrete. Absolute, pure, infinite form is
expressed as self-consciousness, the Ego.</p>

<p>8. This is a light that breaks forth on spiritual substance,
and shows absolute content and absolute form to be identical;—substance
is in itself identical with knowledge. Self-consciousness
thus, in the third place, recognizes its positive
relation as its negative, and its negative as its positive,—or,
in other words, recognizes these opposite activities as
the same, <i>i.e.</i> it recognizes pure Thought or Being as self-identity,
and this again as separation. This is intellectual
perception; but it is requisite in order that it should be in
truth intellectual, that it should not be that merely immediate
perception of the eternal and the divine which we hear of,
but should be absolute knowledge. This intuitive perception
which does not recognize itself is taken as starting-point
as if it were absolutely presupposed; it has in itself
intuitive perception only as immediate knowledge, and not
as self-knowledge: or it knows nothing, and what it
perceives it does not really know,—for, taken at its best, it
consists of beautiful thoughts, but not knowledge.</p>

<p>But intellectual intuition is knowledge, since, in the
first place, in spite of the separation of each of the opposed
sides from the other, all external reality is known as
internal. If it is known according to its essence, as it is,
it shows itself as not existing of itself, but as essentially
consisting in the movement of transition. This Heraclitean
or Sceptical principle, that nothing is at rest, must be
demonstrated of each individual thing; and thus in this
consciousness—that the essence of each thing lies in determination,
in what is the opposite of itself—there appears
the apprehended unity with its opposite. Similarly this unity
is, in the second place, to be recognized even in its essence;
its essence as this identity is, in the same way, to pass
over into its opposite, or to realize itself, to become for itself
something different; and thus the opposition in it is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
about by itself. Again, it may be said of the opposition,
in the third place, that it is not in the Absolute; this
Absolute is existence, the eternal, &amp;c. This is, however,
itself an abstraction in which the Absolute is apprehended
in a one-sided manner only, and the opposition is apprehended
only as ideal (<i>supra</i>, p. 536); but in fact it is form, as
the essential moment of the movement of the Absolute.
This Absolute is not at rest, and that opposition is not the
unresting Notion; for the Idea, unresting though it is, is
yet at rest and satisfied in itself. Pure thought has
advanced to the opposition of the subjective and objective;
the true reconciliation of the opposition is the perception
that this opposition, when pushed to its absolute extreme,
resolves itself; as Schelling says, the opposites are in
themselves identical—and not only in themselves, but
eternal life consists in the very process of continually producing
the opposition and continually reconciling it.
To know opposition in unity, and unity in opposition—this
is absolute knowledge; and science is the knowledge
of this unity in its whole development by means of
itself.</p>

<p>This is then the demand of all time and of Philosophy.
A new epoch has arisen in the world. It would appear as
if the World-spirit had at last succeeded in stripping off
from itself all alien objective existence, and apprehending
itself at last as absolute Spirit, in developing from itself
what for it is objective, and keeping it within its own
power, yet remaining at rest all the while. The strife of
the finite self-consciousness with the absolute self-consciousness,
which last seemed to the other to lie
outside of itself, now comes to an end. Finite self-consciousness
has ceased to be finite; and in this way
absolute self-consciousness has, on the other hand, attained
to the reality which it lacked before. This is the whole
history of the world in general up to the present time, and
the history of Philosophy in particular, the sole work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
which is to depict this strife. Now, indeed, it seems to
have reached its goal, when this absolute self-consciousness,
which it had the work of representing, has ceased to be alien,
and when spirit accordingly is realized as spirit. For it
becomes such only as the result of its knowing itself to be
absolute spirit, and this it knows in real scientific knowledge.
Spirit produces itself as Nature, as the State;
nature is its unconscious work, in the course of which it
appears to itself something different, and not spirit; but in
the State, in the deeds and life of History, as also of Art,
it brings itself to pass with consciousness; it knows very
various modes of its reality, yet they are only modes. In
scientific knowledge alone it knows itself as absolute spirit;
and this knowledge, or spirit, is its only true existence.
This then is the standpoint of the present day, and the
series of spiritual forms is with it for the present concluded.</p>

<p>At this point I bring this history of Philosophy to a close.
It has been my desire that you should learn from it that
the history of Philosophy is not a blind collection of fanciful
ideas, nor a fortuitous progression. I have rather
sought to show the necessary development of the successive
philosophies from one another, so that the one of
necessity presupposes another preceding it. The general
result of the history of Philosophy is this: in the first
place, that throughout all time there has been only
one Philosophy, the contemporary differences of which constitute
the necessary aspects of the one principle; in the
second place, that the succession of philosophic systems is
not due to chance, but represents the necessary succession
of stages in the development of this science; in the third
place, that the final philosophy of a period is the result
of this development, and is truth in the highest form
which the self-consciousness of spirit affords of itself. The
latest philosophy contains therefore those which went
before; it embraces in itself all the different stages thereof;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
it is the product and result of those that preceded it. We
can now, for example, be Platonists no longer. Moreover
we must raise ourselves once for all above the pettinesses of
individual opinions, thoughts, objections, and difficulties;
and also above our own vanity, as if our individual
thoughts were of any particular value. For to apprehend
the inward substantial spirit is the standpoint of the
individual; as parts of the whole, individuals are like blind
men, who are driven forward by the indwelling spirit of
the whole. Our standpoint now is accordingly the knowledge
of this Idea as spirit, as absolute Spirit, which in
this way opposes to itself another spirit, the finite, the
principle of which is to know absolute spirit, in order
that absolute spirit may become existent for it.
I have tried to develop and bring before your thoughts
this series of successive spiritual forms pertaining to
Philosophy in its progress, and to indicate the connection
between them. This series is the true kingdom of spirits,
the only kingdom of spirits that there is—it is a series
which is not a multiplicity, nor does it even remain a series,
if we understand thereby that one of its members merely
follows on another; but in the very process of coming to the
knowledge of itself it is transformed into the moments of the
one Spirit, or the one self-present Spirit. This long procession
of spirits is formed by the individual pulses which beat
in its life; they are the organism of our substance, an
absolutely necessary progression, which expresses nothing
less than the nature of spirit itself, and which lives in us
all. We have to give ear to its urgency—when the mole
that is within forces its way on—and we have to make it
a reality. It is my desire that this history of Philosophy
should contain for you a summons to grasp the spirit of the
time, which is present in us by nature, and—each in his own
place—consciously to bring it from its natural condition, <i>i.e.</i>
from its lifeless seclusion, into the light of day.</p>

<p>I have to express my thanks to you for the attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
with which you have listened to me while I have been
making this attempt; it is in great measure due to you that
my efforts have met with so great a measure of success.
And it has been a source of pleasure to myself to have been
associated with you in this spiritual community; I ought
not to speak of it as if it were a thing of the past, for I
hope that a spiritual bond has been knit between us which
will prove permanent. I bid you a most hearty farewell.</p>

Vol. IV. Section II. pp. 34-39; Tennemann, Vol. IX. pp. 400-402;
Giordano Bruno: De la causa, principio et uno, Dial. V. pp. 281-284.—On
this opposition of the minimum and the maximum Bruno
wrote several special works, for example, De triplici Minimo et Mensura
libri V. Francofurti apud Wechelium et Fischer, 1591, 8; the
text is hexameters, with notes and scholia; Buhle gives the title as
De Minimo libri V. Another work bears the title: De Monade, Numero
et figura liber; Item De Innumerabilibus, Immenso et Infigurabili:
seu de Universo et Mundis libri VIII. Francof. 1591, 8.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_81" id="Footnote_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a></span> Bruno wrote many such topico-mnemonic works, of which the
earliest are the following: Philotheus Jordanus Brunus Nolanus De
compendiosa architectura et complemento artis Lullii, Paris. ap. Æg.
Gorbinum, 1582. 12.—J. Brunus Nol. De Umbris idearum, implicantibus
Artem quærendi, &amp;c., Paris. ap. eund. 1582. 8. The second part has
the title: Ars memoriæ.—Ph. Jord. Bruni Explicatio XXX sigillorum
&amp;c. Quibus adjectus est Sigillus sigillorum, &amp;c. It is evident from
the dedication that Bruno published this work in England, therefore
between 1582 and 1585.—Jordanus Brunus De Lampade combinatoria
Lulliana, Vitebergæ 1587. 8. In the same place he wrote De Progressu
et lampade venatoria Logicorum, Anno 1587, which he dedicated
to the Chancellor of the Wittenberg University.—Jordanus
Brunus De Specierum scrutinio et lampade combinatoria Raym.
Lullii, Pragæ, exc. Georg. Nigrinus 1588. 8; also printed in the
works of Raymund Lullius.—Also De imaginum, signorum et idearum
compositione Libri III. Francofurti ap. Jo. Wechel. et Petr.
Fischer. 1591. 8.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
